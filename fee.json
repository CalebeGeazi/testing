	"text": "If you already agreed to sit for your regular fee then you are stuck and hopefully they'll give you a big tip. Next time, write into your contract that holiday pay is 1.5x normal rate or whatever you'd like. They then knkw ahead of time and can accept/decline/plan/budget accordingly.\nI would be very upset if I'd hired someone and they tried to change terms shortly before the event. If you do decide to ask for more (which would have been a very fair request ahead of time) then let them know you understand if they decide to change their plans.\nWhile slightly different, the closest situation to this I've had was a Saturday evening booking for twins. They actually had 8 children total (literally hiding in the barn until after their parents left) and 5 were under 5 years old. They were 5 hours late returning (3am) and then paid me only $6/hr, much less than agreed upon, not to contract, and I was stuck in the middle of nowhere with this angry drunk person as my only ride. Fwiw, this predates uber,yft, etc.\nThe father absolutely flew into a \nrage when I let him know that I charged significantly more for that many children, charged overtime, and needed assistance from his eldest son (13/14) if he still wanted me to babysit the other agreed upon date. Certainly he didn't and found the upcharge unacceptable. The rest of the lesson besides upcharge timing is to be cognizant of the ripple effect on your professional reputation."

You and the parents can message each other back and forth, you get the early mornings email to apply for jobs ahead of those that don\u2019t have the premium, you get a free motor vehicle record check (in case you can\u2019t afford just the background check alone which is $33), you can look up your stats to see if parents are looking at your own profile or not, you will also appear on the higher search lists of parents, and if you add a debit card on file, have 3 reviews on your profile front the people that you know well, on top of messaging parents within 24hrs, you get their Carepro status. Premium is just $20/mo or $50/6mo. You can get a discount if you email them on Facebook.\nDefinitely worth it! We spend more on clothes, shoes, phone, food, therefore I don\u2019t fee this small fee will bankrupt you. However, keep in mind that the premium alone doesn\u2019t guarantee you a job. It will depend on your location, education (degrees), certifications(CPR...), years of experiences, what the job entails, how many kids you will be dealing with and their age matter too and if you are familiar with special needed kids or not. Finally, your biography can be huge help on how you make it outstanding or not. Good luck and screen through more posts on this topic!"

Because I Have had families take advantage of me and have me mopping floors, changing bedding, pet setting, and take advantage of 15-20 minutes past my end time. So now up front I set a daily fee that works for me which includes up to 9 hour's a day, and anytime my families take vacations, I get paid. As this is my income and I count on it. Discuss what they expect from you, up front. And set a daily fee, that work's for you, that you can count on as income, if they cancel or take vacations.  I would not clean and nanny 3 kid's for under $19-20 in my city..a nanny is more than a babysitter, we go to the library, I take the children to and from school and activities and summer camps, parks, cook, dishes,  laundry, and help pick up the house. \n And have 40 plus year's experience..and Cpr trained,  Pay also depends on how far you drive and location? Some small towns don't pay well.\n  You sound stressed, if you are not enjoying this family,  then they may not be the right fit for you. Find a family that makes you feel like part of their family, that you enjoy spending time with the kid's. I have quit families that just were not a good fit for me..."

I do meal prep and once a week kids laundry I give the youngest showers and wash his hair once a week and read him stories and play he naps 2 hours after lunch and I pick girl up from bus stop bus stop about 2 min walk I have to wake up 5 am take bus one hour roughly. Pay is flat rate $375 a week is that good ? I think its great but am I being ripped off ? I live in columbus ohio. Turned down the other job for same time at $12 and hour for two kids because I'd have to clean whole house do serious meals tutor them buy learning supplies out of own pocket and teach them English and be video and audio recorded take two bus and like 11 min walk. And turned down another job for $250 a week just because of price to be honest. And obviously turned down the jobs for $40 and $75 and week. Is the job I chose the best option. I have my current job till augest or September she said so in september another family promised me a full time job for $14 and hour.\nWhat are your opinions ? The hourly pay job not till September and really need constant income. I usually charge $10-15 and hour depending on whats agreed on most my one time jobs was $15 and hour. But this is a gureeted $375 a week and it includes coffee and food on occasion. I just need money till the September job. \nAnd waking up at 5am is hard lol.

Any hours worked I still get my hourly rate and overtime for any over 40. \nDo not look at this as a live-in position. It is not; it\u2019s temporary. I say this because live-ins are not entitled to overtime in *most* states. Live-ins are also not typically paid extra for overnights if they aren\u2019t working. I would consider asking for an extra fee per day, because this is a major luxury to them, and an inconvenience, to say the least, for you. Talk to them about food. Are you welcome to theirs\u2019 or should you get your own groceries? Can you use their washer/dryer? And please, please set boundaries. When you\u2019re off, you\u2019re off. How old are the kids? I ask because kids don\u2019t understand boundaries like this and you\u2019re going to want to discuss with the parents how to deal with it if they are bothering you. \nBottom line, I do think it\u2019s something to consider if you\u2019re feeling comfortable. If you don\u2019t feel comfortable for whatever reason, it is in your right to say no. If you do decide to go forward, make sure you discuss everything with them and maybe get it in writing.

If she wants to deduct according to your rate then that is something you should discuss. However it shouldn't be sprung upon you after you've been late especially if that late was a miscommunication on starting times. You should definitely have a contract set up and have such things outlined but a set fee should definitely not be included. If you are already uncomfortable then maybe you should look for another job. If you want to stay have a conversation with the parents and have them create a short of handbook as to their expectations and the rules."

You are not a mind reader.  Tell her also if your hours are so important to her that she  needs to make sure that your hours should be respected as hers.  So if she tells you in the contract that you are done by 5pm, then if she is late, put it in the contract she owes you  $3,75 for every 15 minutes she is late.  That will set her straight.  I have never had someone tell me I had to pay a late fee.  If she wants you there earlier than your required hours, she needs to let you know the night before by 8:00 p.m..  Two can play her crazy game.  I would look for a new position.  Next time write up a straight forward contract to protect you. Find out all the rules and have them put in writing too. Good luck.

I invest in supplies ( mainly for crafts) and books to stay current on infant/toddler care as it relates to sleep habits etc. I also bring a lot to the table as it relates to meeting appropriate milestones. So, although my area is low, I charge considerably more due to my experience and education. I do not do laundry nor drive children around at that rate. Nor do I offer it at an additional fee.

I once worked for a family where the parents were divorced and I was there strictly for the kids but the dad would call me when we were at the moms and ask me to take the kids to walk his dogs because it\u2019s part of their chores and responsibilities and clean up after the dog. They had two big dogs mind you and the kids were under 10 years old who could not by any means hold onto these untrained dogs during a walk so it turned into me doing all the work and picking up after the dog I told the mom about it and she was livid. She said absolutely not I do not pay you to walk his dogs and clean up after them and she told him I wouldn\u2019t be going back there to do that and if he wanted to pay me from his pocket for walking his dogs he could do that on his own time not on her time that I\u2019m being paid for. \nMy current family on the other hand has a dog that they always forget to give breakfast to and it upsets me because a dog should get just as much love and attention has a child otherwise why have one? So I give him breakfast every day and let him outside through out the day but that\u2019s it doesn\u2019t involve any real labor so therefore I don\u2019t charge them for it."

If they want high school students to spend the night or work 8 hours , or weekend help, or if its a single man. or the parents or house hold person will be out and return at nights, any your there alone with them, its shady, There are other things too. If They want someone to take care of the personal needs ( cook baths, toileting, laundry  etc.) and its a single man, their just looking for a young girl as something else. I'm sorry.

For the lady who said someone used the \"f\" word, they were just mad that they didn't get their way with you., that's all. They lost. And be careful too of ads that are spelt wrong and not put together grammatical correct, their thoughts are scattered and its very short. And sometimes, I've read where the same ad is written and resubmitted with another person's name, like maybe a friend. If I can help anyone further, let me know? Thanks!"

	"text": "I have been working with this family going on 3 years now. It started out fine, they were taking care of me as they should being their children's caregiver and anything that I needed they offered a helping hand. I slowly started noticing patterns in their behavior and to make a long story short, they are very manipulative. In the interview it was discussed and agreed that I would be the kids nanny and have some light cleaning to be responsible for when the kids were at school. Clearing off the kitchen counter, picking up the kids rooms/ making their beds, running errands, and feeding the kids. Also, it was agreed that when either of the parents get home I would leave and if one of them have the day off I would not be coming in because they can take care of everything. At this point, my expectations have changed (without being talked about or properly compensated), to doing ALL laundry, cleaning the whole kitchen everyday, doing all of the dishes, sweeping the floors, grinding the coffee, organizing the pantry, refrigerators, and freezers. They have asked me to organize the kitchen cabinets, completely organize and clean out the whole basement, meal prep for the parents, cook the parent's dinner often, i've gone errand running for one of the parent's mother often. Sometimes I watch their cousins, even picking up the kids's cousin for school quite a few times and taking them home without any prior notice. They have signed me up to be one of the adults to be present with the kids and all of their cousins when their family comes in from out of town to visit (while the parents were present). They have me stay even when they get home sometimes to WARM UP the kids dinner in the microwave since I prepare their dinner ahead of time. I work Monday-Thursday and they leave laundry and dishes from thursday for when I come back monday. They let their kids sign up for different activities even if they know they wont want to pick them up because it may end too late (they get up really early). Instead they allow it and TELL me not ASK if I can pick up one of them at 8pm and drop them off at home. I don't get any extra for anything and this is not even everything I do/have done. I am very loyal to them and I feel dumb for being so loyal for so long when they don't even have the decency to properly pay me. I love the kids and we have a great relationship but I am not being respected here."

	"text": "My name is Jennifer and I\u2019ve only been on Care.com for about a month and a half. I\u2019m 42 and married to a man who I never would have believed existed, for 6 years. He puts me first in everything he does, which makes it easy for me to do the same. Doing this makes our relationship damned near perfect. We have no children (not for lack of trying), not even before each other, so we are actually in the process of fostering in hopes of adopting. \nI have a B.S. in psychology and and have just three practicums left before attaining my degree for LPC licensure.\nI\u2019ve been a senior caregiver for a few years, as well as working with individuals with mental health disorders. I do have some experience in childcare, but that was a long time ago.\nAbout my experience with this site: I\u2019m frustrated! I have attained two good families as clients. One Nanny position with a tornado of a 4 year old. I watch him in my home for overnights and the occasional day. I also landed a great position with a young disabled woman, also as her overnight caregiver at her house, but I do occasionally work a weekend during the day. While these two clients are great, I\u2019m finding that weeding through the scams, and the true flakes of parents to attain a good position, with good pay and good hours has proven difficult. Between parents canceling interviews last minute or saying they want to hire me then going silent or saying they\u2019re willing to pay my fee ( which is a bit hirer than some) then changing their mind to go with some other caregiver that charges much less, I\u2019m becoming quite impatient and irritated. I do have different profiles, because I have experience with different populations, but I\u2019m finding that most families would rather not pay for good care, to save a few dollars. Also, because on my first service I didn\u2019t have a contract, I was stiffed. I interviewed with a William Bell here in chattanooga to care for his elderly mother. He actually set the pay at 20.00 an hour. I literally only worked one hour, as she only needed changing, a bed bath, and bedding changed. They live just one mile from me. Following my service I waited for payment and he stated he wanted to hire me for two times a day (two hours each trip) but pay me on the first of every month. Um, no, that\u2019s not going to work for me and I requested my payment, which he didn\u2019t have. He\u2019s now not responding to any messages through the app or his phone. He did call me two days following the initial service to request I come back and I declined until I can attain payment for the service already received. I\u2019m just  disgusted  that this man can have a caregiver come to his home, clean up his mother who was sitting in a 10x urine soaked brief, bathe her, change her soaking wet bedclothes, and make sure she was in great shape before leaving and have the audacity to not pay. It\u2019s just 20.00 but it\u2019s the principle. I\u2019m close to going to his home to make an in person request. \nAnyway I do hope to attain a more stable clientele from this site because private contracting does pay much more than agency work and honestly I feel more supportive here. Thank you and"

I don\u2019t really mind, as I can interact with the children in their environment and where the parent feels they\u2019re safer, but I\u2019m always super nervous. I understand it\u2019s a pain to get little ones together and have them sit or stay within sight range at an interview in a coffee place, but I like to have interviews in public places. It feels safer to me. I always send my parents the address of where I\u2019m going and at what time, and I tell them to call and check on me within 30 minutes if I don\u2019t text them first. Am I being paranoid? What do you guys think?"

	"text": "Okay in my contract I write exactly that I will clean the dishes that I and the kids used during my shift. It also specifies that I will leave The home in no worse condition then when I arrive . Meaning if their slobs when I arrive . I do not have to clean it. It\u2019s purely my choice. I also take pictures  if it\u2019s really bad and make it save time and location so there is no argument over this . It\u2019s either pay me more or I shove all Dishes in sink . Some times I bring plastic bin and leave our dishes in them for the day and wash them in different sink then put it away . If they need a light touch it\u2019s in my contract I have limits for everything because some parents take advantage of us and kindness.\nI write in my contract I will move things out of the way for kids to be safe if the home is their whole playground instead of designated area. I will do children\u2019s laundry 2 full loads a week (3 if their a really nice family make sure you state kids laundry in contract or they can say that includes theirs to!) I also say I will wash &amp; store the dishes I and the kids use DURING MY SHFT ( make sure you put Your Use) or they can argue those dirty piled up dishes from the day before must get cleaned. Now you can empty dishwasher being nice but I literally leave their dishes in the sink  with soap to soak so they note i am not a maid. Same for their laundry. I write laundry services of adult clients can be handled for an extra fee just ask for quote. \n\nSome people let their kids destroy their rooms and homes with messes but it\u2019s not your job to clean all that . I also state messes in the home that occur before nanny arrival time may be cleaned at the nannies choice to best of his or her ability. I have had  a client leave clothes  to food to toys all over home . I try my best to always pick up the food and toys so kids don\u2019t get hurt because eventually they take a nap. But I toss all their laundry on their bedroom floors  in neat pile or in hamper . I also state that if the beds need to be changed I only service them once a week to be changed for free ( but not washed just tossed into hamper )  . I only drive children up to a 20 mile radius  in a day using only one Gallon  of gas per  day. So if the park is 10 miles  to go to play we are only driving 10 miles back .Anything further then 20 miles a day. A gas trip credit will be given for further field trips. Mileage reimbursement doesn\u2019t matter if your sitting in traffic eating your gas . I also charge a flat rate of $30 allowance to drive kids to school on top of caring for them . Just make your contract specific or just create a guidelines paper if they don\u2019t want to sign a contract and say these are the services I provide in clear notation so they cannot argue your responsibilities. I give parents my FAQ / Guidelines before they interview  me or or during so they can read it over . Most people skim over it but it\u2019s very precise. If it\u2019s 5 pages long people get bored of reading but it surely tells them precisely what I WILL DO. Even down to cleaning the kids bathroom once a week or twice . I only take out the household trash three times a week or once daily if the can in house is small. I only vacuum the home twice a week and I have a chore chart I made and I fill out the day,time on paper , take a picture . Leave on fridge and parents sign it so again no argument over what\u2019s done . Because some people will treat you like a maid . Very rarely has this happened but that was before I wrote up a paper saying my guidelines . I also make parents sign it saying they understand before I provide care in their home . It also mentions pet care limitations and shot policy. A dog cat or whatever they have could get sick at any point I need to know I\u2019m safe if they bite or harm me . I also write a form saying they agree they have had all shots,are friendly and in the event they hurt me they agree to handle my medical treatment. Just be very clear via writing or some agreement you can pull like email that your notified them."

What I would ask for is for them to pay the hourly rate from the moment you start working in the morning, until you return from school drop off (or any hour that you\u2019re working for them) at the regular rate. Perhaps ask them to round the hourly rate to $17/hr. But very important that in addition to this, you ask for an overnight fee. Depends on the area you live in, but usually a flat $50 overnight fee is fair (which covers the fact that you\u2019re staying there, meaning they still pay the hourly rate until you get them to sleep)."

Summer isn't the best time to find a permanent job, but you never know.  \nI also take a journal with me and write down exactly what the parent wants.  This way I can go back and if needed ask for raise.  I have found that some families keep adding tasks to your duties.  You are there for the kids not a house keeper.  Doing laundry, putting away dishes, cleaning up after kids is a given. (Usually)  Any added chores you need to negotiate with the family.  \nHope this helps."

	"text": "I provide sick care but this is something I discussed with the parents beforehand and is in my contract. If the whole family is sick, I do not have to come in and still get paid. I am also given a few paid sick days. Since you did not discuss it, they probably assumed you would provide sick care since many nannies do. I have done research on this. Some nannies will only provide sick care for common viruses, but anything highly contagious, the parents provide it. It varies and is something discussed prior to starting a position. If you do provide sick care, you wouldn\u2019t get an extra fee (I\u2019ve never heard of this), but you should get a few paid sick days per year. Unfortunately, a baby who is harder to take care of doesn\u2019t warrant you extra pay. It\u2019s just the reality. Thats something you sign up for. I know it\u2019s hard, though; I don\u2019t want to sound insensitive. Honestly, extra pay won\u2019t really make it any easier, though. Since you mentioned baby is better for parents, ask mom for a t shirt or something she wears often, and either wear it or wrap baby in it. I\u2019ve heard this works. \nYou should be paid hourly with time and half for any hours over 40 in a week. There are even some states (like California) where you even get paid time and half for any hours you work over 8 in one day, regardless of how many hours you work in a week. So look up your state laws on that. I know it\u2019s hard working long days. I used to work 11 hour days 5 days a week as a live-in for twin infants. It was a sacrifice for sure, one that was not recognized by the parents. Parent acknowledgement goes a long way in keeping nanny happy. Is your nanny family appreciative? If you\u2019re struggling with long hours, you may need a job change. Many factors went into me leaving that position, but the fact that I was not appreciated and my long hours and hard work were never acknowledged, it didn\u2019t help me stay. It was more complicated than just that but I am so much happier now that I\u2019m in a job working less hours, paid hourly, and appreciated. \nAre you using any cough syrup or anything for baby? Ask parents first, of course, but have them look into it if you\u2019re not. The pediatrician recommended Zarbees or Highlands for us and it actually worked pretty well. One of the babies loved it, too, which was pretty cute. He would smile when I was feeding it to him. If you do go that route, I recommend putting it in a syringe and feeding him out of that slowly, rather than from the packet. Bring a wet cloth over and take off the top half of baby\u2019s clothes because the sticky gets everywhere lol. \nSorry you\u2019re in this situation. As far as sickness, just remember that it does get better. Just keep telling yourself it\u2019s only a few days, it\u2019s only a few days. And practice some good self care when you leave for the day. \nGood luck, anon!"

I've also dabbled with if a family had a set schedule and it changes through the week, say a day working has now become a day off, the family will pay you half pay. \n\nBe careful with being off the books. If you make under a certain amount you won't have to file taxes. If it is over you'll want to consider having the family file you house hold employee. That way you'll have a w2. And they may even be able to claim a child care credit for their taxes. Might entice them to make the change.  You'll even be able to claim your car and gas for work. \n\nThere is also a nanny care act. If your most recent pay is under minimum wage you should definitely ask for a raise but maybe reconsider asking for less hours. \n\nWith your credentials you are over qualified and they are very lucky to have someone with your training as one on one. \n\nGood luck!"

In the bank they go out for lunch and coffee, nanny stay and work with children from 8am to 6pm, nanny don\u2019t receive health insurance, pension, in the bank if you work more then 40 hours you receive over time but not a nanny, so how you can compare between a nanny and a bank worker.\nSusan B, what about having some sympathy to other nannies who only speak on the phone when the child nap.

Working interviews really give a good idea  how family dynamics work. Parents usually book 1-3 hours paid. Cleaning is different, maybe you could get a deposit as one suggested."

The flat fee was $100. She said it was mainly \u201csleeping\u201d.\nI really needed work so I started. Even though the flat fee hourly was way below min. wage. And when I lived in with my mom-in-law, we paid caregivers a min. Of $10 up to $17 an hour. So I did the job for about 2 1/2 mos. Found out the only \u201csleeping\u201d part was a lie. Sometimes she would get up 12x in 12 hours. She needs help in the bathroom, she was mean & cranky & stinky. Their couch which I had to sleep on, was in the next room, and it was from 1950. Horrible. They had a machine that would play a very loud bug,e song if she went to get up to alert the overnight caregiver which was traumatizing. \nAnd had cameras everywhere that all of her adult children could look at, 2 of them men in their 50s. I\u2019m 56. Anyway, I could not take it anymore, I gave my notice stating, that the flat fee was to low, that it was not just sleeping, and even if it was, my time is my time! And I deserve to get paid for it, for being there &available to the person needing care. \nMy advice to is to not forget your worth. Charge for your time no master what you are doing. From when you walk in until you leave. You get paid for every hour period! \nThat\u2019s a 13 hr. shift. You should get paid a min. of $10 IF it truly is sleeping. And up to $15 per hour. Or $150 a night is about $12 an hour, that\u2019s min. wage. \nDon\u2019t  undercut yourself. Or sell yourself short. Being there for a Senior is a big responsibility that you deserve to get paid well & fairly for. \nIf they had to put their senior in assisted living, the cost is so much more. I hope this helps!"

We have to remain professional though, and remember that this is a job and not our family. The parents are going to generally see us as employees and nothing more most of the time - \u201ctools\u201d to accomplish having their needs met. There needs to be some sort of contract with families from the beginning so we have a clear what our hours and responsibilities are, and what our hourly pay will be, paid time off, late fee charges, etc. As soon as an employer starts willy-nilly basically telling you to change hours, take on new duties, change pay, etc., it is time to say \u201cno\u201d or move on and find a new family. It\u2019s best to keep a professional distance, and not let ourselves get too involved in their family dynamic and issues. We are there to do a job and have to remember that. Just like any job though, if you end up with a horrible boss, or intolerable working conditions, you need to give notice and walk away because you\u2019ll just end up feeling worse and worse when you stay and things don\u2019t get better."

No rollovers and that is because your time is valuable and this is your job. \n\nFamilies book with you because you are responsibile, flexible, trusting and overall great at what you do and because you are great, many people are happy to use your serivce and are counting on your availability. \n\nWhen a family cancels time that you have set a side and possibly cancelled other gigs or plans for it is extremely inconvenient. So, they are paying for an agreed commitment that goes both ways.\n\n For the families who do not agree with the non-refundable option it's ok you most likely won't loose then as clients rather you will enclurahe them to wait until they are completely sure they will need you without fail and if you are still available then everyone wins. Wheb yiu tell then you are already booked they will see the value of planning ahead and booking you along the terms of your booking fee (this way you have raised your value).\n\nI have had a few cancellations since implementing this and the families have honored the nonrefundable deposit without push back. I have also learned that this is why I have it in place because I use to feel devalued when I saved a date for someone then they cancel and I have a day without pay when I could've booked with someone else or planned my day better."

	"text": "I\u2019m with you on this; implementing a cancellation fee would be fair and it would also deter clients from cancelling so often. Clients should give reasonable notice to cancel. That way you can fill that opening in your schedule without you losing revenue. What is reasonable? I say 48 hours prior to the time you are supposed to start cleaning that house. If clients don\u2019t give you reasonable notice, you should charge anywhere from 50% to the full amount of the project. \nHow do the clients react? It depends. If I\u2019ve made it clear to them about my cancellation policy, they usually volunteer to pay me or neg\u00f3ciate a time that works for the both of us to make up for that cleaning. \nHonestly, many clients don\u2019t like it you charge for a cancellation. I used to be very diligent about this, but I backed down after I felt so much resistance against this policy. The reality is that the industry has to work in the same way like you by having cancellation fees. Clients need to be informed and expect to pay for a cancellation, but since there is very few cleaning people who charge for cancellations, most of the clients don\u2019t like it and you might feel threatened with losing that client potentially. So, my advise is go with your instinct: if a client makes it a habit to cancel the weekly cleaning, implement an additional fee next time you clean. Say that you need to spend more time, energy and chemicals to clean after 2 weeks and you have to charge for that."

Then she said that her kids were \"dropping like flies\" and that she had just lost four more today, due to parents now being at home.  \nI did daycare for ten years and not once do I remember any tp restocking emergrncies.  And how many kids can she have left at this point, anyway?    \nThis is the mentality that is causing the grocery stores to be cleaned out, mob panic.  I shop every few days, just for a few things, but when I saw the shelves so empty I had to think about buying extra because there might not be anything there at all next time.\nThis is a very contagious virus, and we do need to make space for a while, but people, relax! There is no food supply crisis, just people hoarding.  \nSo tomorrow I have to find some coffee.  \nBless us all."

Every so often I have the issue with clients canceling. I usually ask for a 48 hour notice and anything before that I charge a $20 cancellation fee. I courteously wave first first cancellation as well. However today I had a client book a cleaning. She booked it online threw my other site. I txt and confirmed her cleaning with her. I got ready. Drove all the way over to their home   Once I got there she then said .. oh I thought this was just the meet and greet not the actual cleaning. She proceeds to tell me they have planned a party on the 26th and needed something closer. I told her if she wanted to reschedule today that I could open up Sunday the 20th for her and not charge any extra fee for having to reschedule either. She said that would work better. I went on with the walk threw and left and everything seemed great. Later tonight around 7pm I get a txt with additional questions and then saying they changed their minds sorry for wasting my time!  \n\nAt times I feel like I need to have a deposit for clients to even book and put that towards their cleanings if they don\u2019t cancel. I feel like this could possibly scare clients off too. I hate being in situations like this bc not only do I take the hit but I am usually booked and had to turn a client away bc this lady already had a \u201ccleaning\u201d booked."

It doesn't matter if you're a Nanny or a Housekeeper there are many times that you aren't aware of that your client thinks, \"Wow, Jessica completely reorganized the kids playroom and it looks the best it ever has,\" but because of a dinner engagement that evening with clients she neglected to mention to you how much she appreciated it.  Your value isnt measured in a gift, although the gifts and bonuses are wonderful, your value is measured in your work ethic.  If you go home at night and you did your very best that day ... be proud of yourself,  treat yourself to an amazing coffee at Starbucks or that forbidden milkshake at Steak and Shake.  Remember, there are many people whose etiquette is far from proper making it hard on the ones who do.  I'm currently a Home Manager of an 18,000 sq. ft. home for a very prominent family in Franklin and in conversations I have with my client, periodically at the end of them she will say three magic words, \"I APPRECIATE YOU.\"  Those 3 words mean EVERYTHING!!  Although this family is very, very giving like nothing I have ever experienced in all the years I worked in the corporate world.  What means the most to me isn't what they give me materialistically, its that I know I'm appreciated.  In return, I make sure they know how blessed I am to work for them.  If you feel unappreciated do something that isnt expected and let them know at the end of the day.  When you tell them what you did, verbally tell them how much you appreciate being able to care for their family and tell them often.  Making your client feel appreciated could change everything.  Chin up sweet girl ... my heart goes out to you, Hugs."

	"text": "I\u2019m so sorry for your situation; I\u2019ve been in your shoes & been burned before in the same way.\n\nUnfortunately, most people think of nanny work like babysitting: you are paid for the time you work (hourly). However, being a nanny, you are in a more of a contractual, recurring agreement, where you are not just paid for your time, but the RESERVATION of your time to be allotted to them, not someone else. (Think: like many hotel rooms, beauty services, or tickets to a venue, you pay for that space or time to be reserved for YOU and not sold to someone else; otherwise, there is a fee. That\u2019s how they make & guarantee their income, just like you!) \n\nIf you do not have any form of a written agreement or contract, I suggest you do this & spell out specifically what your scheduled days/hours are at minimum (with room for add-ons when mutually agreed upon). I\u2019m sure you can find samples or templates for work agreements online. Then, add a paragraph spelling out your hourly rate, and your cancelation policy. For example, if you wish to go on vacation or take time off, you will give (___) day\u2019s/week\u2019s notice & it will be at no charge to the client. (This is to give them the courtesy of time to find a replacement in your absence, which they should appreciate!) If they wish to take a vacation/time off, they must also give (___) days/weeks notice and either provide make-up opportunities for you to work the time lost within that pay-period, or pay your wage for your missed time. You can also decide if the advance notice is enough without charging them, if it would give you sufficient time to find some one-time jobs to make up the loss.\nEither way, you should always have a work agreement, both for your sake and theirs, so everyone is on the same page. It\u2019s not personal; it\u2019s only good business.(Nearly every other form of employment/service does!)\n\nBest of luck to you!"

She tells me what to do in everything. For example, she pick out the baby\u2019s clothes in the morning, for him to wear throughout the day. Sometimes though, the baby spits up badly or has a diaper accident and I have to change his clothes. When I tell her we have to change the baby she tells me I can pick out the new clothes. I go and change his clothes I put on a decent outfit, when she sees him she says \u201cnot that outfit\u201d \u201clet pick out something different\u201d. Then a couple days later she picks out the outfit I had picked out and she didn\u2019t like. Another example: one of the baby\u2019s sock is falling of she notices and says his sock is about to fall off. So I go and try to either fix it or take his socks off and she\u2019ll say \u201cjust leave it, let it fall on it\u2019s own\u201d. So I back up and leave it, as soon as I do that she say \u201cno let\u2019s take them off\u201d. She also tells her husband what to do and when to do it, if he doesn\u2019t she gets mad with everyone and she starts complaining about how stressed out she is. Sometimes their 5year old daughter is telling me something when the mom is not in the room and she comes in fast asking what we are talking about, (it could be about preschool, her favorite food/color conversation) she also does it when I\u2019m in the kitchen talking to her husband, she storms in asking what we are talking about. She tells me when to sit when to drink my coffee etc. Sometimes it\u2019s unbearable."

And PAY for that time! \n\nGiven that this is San Francisco, I'm not at all surprised that people are willing to have me walk into their homes and be alone with their children for hours, but I'm stunned by the number of those same people who balk at the thought of meeting me FIRST and paying me for that time! Many services charge a deposit, and whether they offer me a cup coffee and call it \"coming over for a drink ( I hate coffee)\" I still arrive and behave exactly as professionally as I would for those 45-75 minutes if they were actually leaving the house. Having them phrase it as \"coming over to meet\" doesn't mean it isn't work for me. \n\nIt's still my time, and as many of you have pointed out, our time is money.

I don't feel like cleaning out cat litter boxes is a part of house cleaning that should be their responsibility and I would let them know that that's not part of the deal. I'm not sure how many hours you're wanting to work but you need to let them know I work 3 hours and no more so whatever cleaning I get done I'm done and I need to leave to my next job. I've worked for an elderly couple for 3 years and I have the same problem they can't get up and down so I spend at least an hour and a half cleaning up dishes on the coffee table and napkins and all that kind of thing before I can get in the kitchen and clean up the kitchen. If you're ready to end this job you need to give them two weeks notice so they can find someone else and just let him know that you're not able to do another job on Mondays because of the hours that they need you so for your financial needs you're going to have to end this relationship. And then you don't need to say anything else give them a date that you're going to stop working for them and then just come in and work whatever hours you establish with them three or four hours and then go home.

	"text": "I am not sure where you live however each state has caregiver labor laws. Because of people just like you are working for there is a labor law for live-in assignments/24hr care.  The bottom line its always about the money.  The money families pay for care and the financial benefit the caregiver earns.  Your client is demonstrating to you, she has no respect for your service.  Its not that she does not respect you as a person, she has no respect the service you are providing.  I have been a caregiver for close to twenty years, the demand for caregivers great.  One would think that would be great, job security is a premium.\nI am for the most part an independent caregiver, I am also registered with several senior care agencies.\nWhen I have been interviewed over the years, during the interview process  I am frequently asked what I like about being a caregiver and what I don't like.  After answering their question, I ask them the same question.  Every agency responded what they dislike is far to many families can be difficult.  When anyone ever refers to another person a feisty or difficult.  RUN!! \n\nYou are working for the vary client the labor law as set up to protect.  How sad is that for the families who have good values.  I understand paying for care is costly.  I understand for many, the fee for care is dipping into their inheritance.   Based on the information you provided what you are being paid and what you are actually too, nothing short of labor abuse.\n\nPlease stop discussing your position with your client.  The book the \"Help\" was said to be based on fiction.  Sad but true,  there has always been and always will some clients just like yours, who view you as the \"Help\".    She does not care about your opinions.  Save your breath.\n\nWe all make a very good living from many families who advertise on care.com.  Its a win for the families and its for sure a win for the families.  Paying senior care agencies the rates they charge can be an extreme hardship.  I live in California, our labor law which covers live in care would entitle you $400 each day.   Undisturbed days off.   There are 365 days in a year  365x$400=$146,000.   As an independent we often discount our fee.   Unfortunately when we settle,  we end up settling for nothing.   \n\nThe only high price in my opinion, is the price you are paying for the adverse impact this abuse is having on your health both physically and mentally.    This is a first for me to suggest, seek legal advice."

When I booked a maid service for a move-out cleaning, she required me to pay at least 50% 72 hours before the scheduled booking (I could also pay the full price). And then 24 hours before the booking, I paid the rest of the money owed. I think this is pretty standard. Unfortunately, this is the world we live in where some clients have no respect for our time and money. \nI personally think it\u2019s reasonable to also have some kind of deposit a certain number of days before a childcare booking, too. I see so many stories on here where parents cancel last-minute, causing caregivers to lose out on other opportunities for payment. A 72- or 48-hour deposit, that goes towards the overall fee, for a babysitting gig isn\u2019t unreasonable. That could deter parents from making last minute cancellations. You could always have a first-time forgiveness policy, or if you have a regular client who is always consistent, make an exception for them if they only cancel once. \nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having this trouble.

If you go through some previous posts, you will also find more information about this topics.\nWhichever contract you decide to use, you and the parents can edit it to your likings but adding or removing things.\nA contract will lay out your duties and responsibilities. For example if you just want to tend the baby, then don\u2019t agree on housekeeping and pet care.\nIf you will drive kids around, give them the IRS of 57.5 cents per mileage to cover your gas, wears and years from your car (don\u2019t just accept a flat $20 for them). Also, you will be paid hourly whether it\u2019s at the end of each day or just on Fridays when you are done ready to go home. You can add a cancelation fee of $20 per day for each lateness. And if they are more than 3 times late you can decide to add in the contract that it will terminate your work. You can decide a minimum commitment for example 3 months or a maximum of a year. But each year you will have to revise and generate a new contract. Paid vacation or sick days? What if grandparents come other and they won\u2019t need you? Do they still have to pay you? Yes! Make sure to get a guaranty hours whether they will need you or not.\nAbove all, they have to enroll you for HOMEPAY from Care to take care of your deductions by generating you a W4 to be fill out and a W2 at the end of January so that you can do your taxes. Don\u2019t take this job unless this has been taken care off. Do not agree the 1099 form!

I noticed there wasn\u2019t a keep up of what I was doing during the week, I would come in from the weekend and there would be 5+ bottles already in the sink. I didn\u2019t stop until it continued over to when baby transitioned to sippy cups. I stopped washing the cups because I thought it was very unfair to come in and see multiple cups. I just felt like what I would do closing out my week wasn\u2019t being appreciated. I also use to hand wash regular dishes but I was unfamiliar with the kitchen so I would leave the clean dishes on one side of the sink and cleaning the other side leaving it empty and I would let mom know that they were clean BUT somehow they wouldn\u2019t put them away and would eventually add dirty dishes to it. I work full time so when I have the time it\u2019s a slight chance I wouldn\u2019t have that free time to do so again so I get it all done in one setting. It\u2019s been months since I\u2019ve stopped washing the cups and mom has kept up with them but it isn\u2019t a 100% consistent thing also I sometimes feel bad because I do have times I could help but I really don\u2019t want to feel like I\u2019d be taking advantage of again. Should I start back cleaning babies cups and offer help to keep their dishes clean for a fee or just let that be something the family should worry about? I\u2019m a little ocd and I hate how the dishes pile up. Also I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to use multiple sippy cups I\u2019m fine with reusing maybe 2."

It all depends on your experience, and my  thought is that typically if they say will $100 be adequate, I would have responded by, when I applied for this job, it was between 15 - 25 per hour.  My rate is this.  \n\nI also want to say that when I first started out 17 years ago in the care business, some clients will get away with doing that.  It reminds me of bargaining at a garage sale.  \n\nWhy would they want to pay someone that little for their children?   Please continue to look, because in your heart if you are not happy about the wage right off of the bat, it will be a resentful situation.  I would say at least 5.00 above minimum wage. \n\nIf you have been doing this for years, a minimum of $25.00, as well as specific hours, and if they are over the allotted time, I would for children only charge a time an 1/2 fee because childcare can be tricky.  They may have friends over, you have alot of little lovely children, playing, and you are responsible for them.  Remember to ask yourself what you are worth.  \n\nThat is what you need to tell them.  Do that when the time is appropriate. \n\nWe all need to stick together and become a large team of Professional Caregivers, as the average wage is not a living wage, and I know if we stand together, that will change. \n\nGood Luck."

Do the parents currently have any baby wearing gear that you can use too?\n\nBonding can take up to 3 weeks. It is hard work, working with infants! It is physical work that also demands a high degree of emotional intuition. Keeping a journal of your struggles and successes will help you see the value of your dedication and it may help you through the bonding process.\n\nIt will be different with your own children, when you can decide how to help them learn to sleep, but when we work for others we agree to follow their plan even when we see other, even better ways to help the child. Once we have a better understanding of bother the parents and the child we can begin to offer our observations and see how they are received. Many parents will be receptive and others will be uninterested or even offended. It takes time, it's relationship building, trust and experience.\n\nI encourage you to try to stick with this, and address the fee you want to charge and accompany that with a formal contract from Nanny Counsel."

It takes alot of time, and is a very  hard but really is the best way to own your life, take control of when you want to work and make sure that an Agency does not take 50% or more of the fee.    If people are willing to pay that, then people on Care need to get liability insurance.  Very cheap for Care Professionals, \"Business Professional Insurance\" $7.00 for myself. \nas well as the knowledge of how to reach out to clients.  Before I changed my career due to my parents Dementia  (Alzheimer's and Lewy Body), I was in the Banking Industry and have a college degree, the my motivations were pure and simple, to reach out to our community and to make a difference.  \n\nI do need this money to survive, and have been able to be busy full time 365 days a week if I wanted too, but I am 60 and do not ever want to get caregiver burnout like I did years ago.  \n\nKeep focusing on what you really want, as it is alot of work to Market yourself.  I would write a personal letter addressing the person stating why you are applying to the job you are applying for, as well as what are your positive skills specific to this job that makes you a great fit. \n\nI know care.com is very concerned about our safety and they do not like use to put our phone numbers.  If you want to do it that way, let them know, \"please do email me on care.com and I will immediately contact you through care chat\".  I have another way of doing it, as I have not had alot of success with care chat, and have a question into their tech department.  But like I have said, this is alot of work, and you are basically running your own small business even though you are not, because caregiving and hompay. go together."

	"text": "Just to qualify my answer, because of my educational background and skillset, I am at the higher rate of what most nanny's, caregivers charge (around $50+hr). That said, even in the areas and families I work for, its pretty established that *night rate is much lower than waking hours and generally a flat rate at about 1/3 of waking hours rate (*if the caregiver is just sleeping over and children are sleeping-- the rate is obviosuly very different for a night nurse or if the child frequently awakens during these hours. That is also contingent upon the parent not requesting any other services--errands, cleanup, etc). For example, for a family that paid $25/hr for waking care, it would be about $8hr or $65-75 flat rate for overnight stay--this is in Southern California. This price can be higher on weekends though. So if you are in a rural area I would take those hourly rate numbers and calculate that way. (For example, if $12/hr then 1/3 that so about $4-5/hr night rate. at a flat fee x8hours =$30-40 night. Hope this helps and best of luck with your search!"

	"text": "If you are there as a caregiver, you should be privy to what the doctor has said and be asking what the goals are, etc. The first person I cared for (other than children) was my Grandmother. When I took her home from the hospital her \u201cdoctor\u201d told me, \u201cDont worry about her diet - she won\u2019t last more than a couple of weeks.\u201d And they had her on meds to \u201ckeep her calm - more like a drooling idiot. This was a woman who was a Director of a famous psychiatric hospital and then taught Nursing at NYU.  Her psychiatrist friend had me dismiss her doctor and told me who to go and we got her off all the mood altering drugs. The psychiatrist brought me dietary books, a book on sodium contents and low sodium cooking, etc. He also said it was VITAL to take her for a walk every day at least around the block every day, even in those NY winters. He told us do NOT let her have a wheelchair or she\u2019d give up and never get up again. A couple friends thought it was \u201cmean\u201d that I had her on such a strict diet and made her walk in the winter - until they got her a piece of apple pie (tons of sodium in pie) and a cup of coffee (caffeine and sugar - made her wired like a hyperactive kid and her heart race) when they were supposed to be walking - and the next day her ankles were like balloons and she felt terrible and antsy and I had to take her to the doctor. My point is: make sure you know what you\u2019re talking about before you judge.\n\nI kept a full time live in Aide for her and continued to live with her So I could go out to work. After just a couple of months we were able to start going out to dinners at her favorite upscale restaurants (just have to know how to order), movies, walks and shows in Central Park, etc. She lived almost 4 more years, and able to walk around on her own."

So I started nannying for this family about 6 months ago and things were going great at first. They have two children. But one of them has some physical and emotionally developmental challenges that I fee like are very downplayed by the mother and I wasn\u2019t prepared for how taxing it would be to care for this child. And the other is so easy going and very un-complicated to care for (this child is a baby and still less work than the older sibling to give some perspective without sharing too much personal detail). I have realized recently that I have a bond with the easier child and have started to not really have a bond with the other child. I\u2019m just not really too sure what to do in this situation. I don\u2019t want to leave because the job is a very good one and hard to come by and I do have a bond with the one child. I\u2019m just not sure how to form a bond with this other child and get past all my frustrations with how much extra work it is than what I was prepared for. Please don\u2019t tell me I\u2019m being lazy or something like that. This child\u2019s challenges and delays are extremely emotional and physically draining on me and I feel like the family doesn\u2019t fully acknowledge that and seems to be in a bit of denial which only makes things worse. I really do want to find a way to make this work. I\u2019m just not sure what to do. Any advice is appreciated if it comes from a good place. Thank you!"

There have been multiple deaths of children under the age of 1.  As well the rape of  a 7 year old girl, and many other children who have been abused because of the manipulative, sneaky and dangerous individuals who take advantage of this platform. A simple google search will inform you why it is so important that we advocate for these children. Honestly im nervous my account will be removed after i make this post. \n\n1. Care.com babysitter Sarah Gumm was convicted of murder and sentenced to 23 years in jail for beating a 3-month-old to death. Prior to registering on Care.com she had two DUIs, a \u201cbattery incident,\u201d and a felony charge \u2014 all of which went undetected by Care.com\u2019s background check.\n\n2. Care.com babysitter Sarah Cullen was convicted of murder and sentenced to 70 years in jail for killing a 4-month-old child. She had a DUI prior to registering on Care.com.\n\n3. Care.com babysitter Aisling McCarthy Brady had no prior criminal history prior to registering on Care.com, but had overstayed her visa. A one-year-old died in her care. She was found not guilty in a criminal charge, but the family was later awarded $4 million in a new lawsuit.\n\n4. On March 2018, Care.com babysitter Jonathan Tavara-Nima was sentenced to 25 years for raping a seven-year-old girl he met on Care.com. Care.com said his account \u201cwould be removed and blacklisted.\u201d Care.com didn\u2019t mention that he had been arrested for child pornography charges five years earlier.\n\n\nThis is for the real nannies, the ones who live and breath for the finger painting, for the peppa pig songs, for the cuddles, for the ones who choose to advocate for children. Some how some way we do need a change to this platform so the children will be safe\n\npeace &amp; love"

They will send you a check with \"more money\" than the amount previously proposed by them and later they will reach out to you again saying to send the difference back. The problem; is a bad check and by the time that bounces back you already gave them the money plus the bounce check fee. When is too good to be true, is more likely to be a scam."

I would not take the approach of it being a confrontation but more of a conversation about what you can offer in your care services.\nPersonally, if the mother is wanting a more \u2018on call basis Infant care\u2019 then this should be worked into your hourly rate-Which means your being well compensated OR as a base fee per week, like $150-200 per week for being on call + your hourly rate.\nThis usually clears up any specifics and often employers will choose to pay for the on call fee for the convenience of having someone on call or they will  choose to give you a regular schedule knowing that there would be a cancellation fee if they cancel right before etc.\nI do understand your frustration with planning to be at work at 7am, then to find out it is now 9am, but if you have a fee already built into it, it will resolve the sting. Chances are the family will have this pattern in their character and not take into consideration your effort and end of things especially if it doesn\u2019t impact them financially, so offer the base fee of \u2018on call\u2019 and get their feedback. \nRemind them with a set schedule, they can save the on call fee, or be charged a fee for \u2018day of changes\u2019 or cancellations. \nHope this helps!"

Let's be frank, creating lesson plans is not the job of a tutor. However, it can be provided as part of the service you offer for a fee. Think about it, let's say you will tutor her for an hour once a week, you still have to read and put in another hour or two (estimate) to create an individualized plan for her. So, I encourage you to ask for higher rate on the basis that creating lesson plans is an additional service. \n\nGood luck,\nUchechukwu \nYouTube: Hey Uchechukwu\n\nPS: Make sure they don't expect you to create multiple lesson plans for her each week! The number of plans you provide should match the number of times you tutor her each week."

Anywho, If your nervous to say it to her personally,  text it ( if that's already a way you guys communicate). Text her a message after you get home and explain to her, that you don't want to come off rude.

I agreed and readjusted my schedule.\n\nThey asked if I would watch another child along with their baby for an hourly raise. I agreed to that and I really love both of the kiddos.\n\nBut then last spring I got a call and everything fell apart because the families were having a disagreement about my pay. I was nannying out of Family #1's house and keeping their home clean, cooking for the family during nap, etc. and Family #2 wanted to pay 1/3 of my rate and let Family #1 pay the other 2/3 to make it fair. So I basically lost my job because Family #1 wouldn't do it.\n\nThen a couple days later, the Family #1 called me and asked if I would watch their child out of my own home for a flat fee. I agreed.\n\nAnd Family #2 called too and asked for the same thing. I agreed to that too.\n\nEverything was going well, we all sat down to discuss preschool and they decided that I would watch the kids until August 2021. I bought a lot toys and furniture for my home and really invested in my little at-home daycare. I spent about 1/4 of my pay over a 3 month period on things for these kids.\n\nBut then Family #1 decided that in a couple of months they are sending their kid to preschool early. Family #2 wants to transition to stay-at-home. Both families are fighting me because I need to get a new job and are refusing to help. They pretty much want me to keep my schedule open and keep adjusting my life to progressively lower pay. I can't afford to do it anymore.\n\nWhat do I do? Do I apply to jobs and just pretend I never had this job? When potential employers ask for my references, these families are really stressing that I'm leaving them high and dry. I know that it's hurting my chances but they are the bulk of my nanny experience."

For example, in Wilmington, NC pet boarding at a vet for one dog usually costs $35 on average, for one cat it is $22 on average. Then, if they require you to spend the night, add in an extra fee, maybe $10-20, then any extra services they are requesting of you, grabbing the mail, washing the pets, administering medication, etc. REMEMBER! By visiting their pets in their home, you are making it VERY easy for the pets and the pet owners. They don\u2019t have to check in or pick up their pets, and the animals feel comfortable at home.\n\nCost estimation example: Family has 1 dog and 1 cat, 3 days of pet care, and the dog needs medication: ($40 for the dog) + ($20 for the cat) = $60 x 3 days = $180 minimum."

For others, this is a desperate financial &amp; family crisis.\n\nFor some that live alone they're facing endless loneliness. While for others it is peace, rest &amp; time with their mother, father, sons &amp; daughters.\n\nWith the $600 weekly increase in unemployment some are bringing in more money to their households than they were working. Others are working more hours for less money due to pay cuts or loss in sales.\n\nSome families of 4 just received $3400 from the stimulus while other families of 4 saw $0.\n\nSome were concerned about getting a certain candy for Easter while others were concerned if there would be enough bread, milk and eggs for the weekend.\n\nSome want to go back to work because they don't qualify for unemployment and are running out of money. Others want to kill those who break the quarantine.\n\nSome are home spending 2-3 hours/day helping their child with online schooling while others are spending 2-3 hours/day to educate their children on top of a 10-12 hour workday.\n\nSome have experienced the near death of the virus, some have already lost someone from it and some are not sure if their loved ones are going to make it. Others don't believe this is a big deal.\n\nSome have faith in God and expect miracles during this 2020. Others say the worst is yet to come.\n\nSo, friends, we are not in the same boat.

	"text": "*This is a long read but I'd appreciate any kind of feedback!* I started working 2 days a week for a family with a 5 month old preemie a little over a year ago (I am 26 the mom is 40), found them through care and after glowing references and a wonderful interview the mom low balled me well below my desired hourly rate- I agreed to it on the terms that we re-evaluate after 6 months or so or in the case that they ask me to work more hours (I'm talking a $6/hour difference between what they wanted to pay me and what I get with the other families I work with so I truly could not afford to work for them) I balance multiple families a week, all families I've been with for 3+ years and maintain wonderful professional relationships with all of them\nThis woman though is cut from a different cloth. I always follow the lead of my employers when it comes to my relationship with them, in the case of this woman she needed a friend, she would have me come to the house at 10am and the baby would usually be asleep and she wouldn't leave for work until 11am, so we would have an hour to chat and get to know each other (again following her lead, she would be the one to initiate) over the months I became very close with her, she would get home from work and invite me to stay and have a glass of wine, some nights I would have dinner with them, she even set me up with my current partner. (I don't have a relationship like that with any other family I work with- like I said I follow my employers lead and this is the setting she created) We shared intimate details of our lives with each other, she created an environment where I felt welcome and told me over and over that I was family and that she cared about me. \nDespite all this I still maintained a professional way about me when I was \"on the clock\" because I take my responsibilities seriously! A few months ago she asked if she could start booking me for a third day a week, I agreed because I felt like we were friends and I wanted to help- but it would mean I would forgo more money/hour by not leaving the day open for other families (again something in me felt like I could do her this solid because she made me feel like family). \nThere had been red flags here and there, they have home security cameras and she would text me from work criticizing my any time the baby cried, so I knew she was watching every move I made, she told me she even watches the cameras when it's just her husband home with the baby (she has trust issues) she confided in me early on that if anything happened to her child in the care of her husband she would kill him, a few months after that she made a \"joke\" saying that if anything happened to the child in my care she wouldn't hesitate to kill me too (they are a gun owning family) says it with a chuckle but also a dark look in her eyes. \nThis woman would change my schedule every few weeks, the hours would be wonky, sometimes she would cancel a day on me last minute (so I'm out of a day's worth of income) but through all of this I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and remember that she considered me part of the family and maybe I was being too sensitive. In the entire year I have worked with them I only called out sick once (I have an autoimmune disease and had a huge flare up) and I was so utterly apologetic and she tried to make me feel guilty about it. Her mood would become more erratic and every time I would go over I had no idea what I would walk into, would she be friendly and bubbly and want to chat over coffee or would she be in a rotten mood and reprimand me like a child over something non existent? \nI've done so so much reflection on my own job performance, overthinking everything I do, searching for a reason why she would treat me so poorly but at the end of the day I am confident in the quality of child care I provide, with 10+ years experience and happy long-term work with many other families I realized that the problem was her, no child care will ever be good enough for her. \nI had gotten to know the kind of woman she is and she is a master manipulator and proud of it, she shared stories that would paint her in such a cruel and unkind light but she would talk like she was proud of how much of a bully she could be. \nLast night when I was leaving I mentioned to the father that because I had been with them for a year I'd like to open the discussion of my pay, I suggested they take the weekend to talk about it and we could touch base next week when I see them again, an hour later I received a paragraph of a text from the mother saying she would never remotely consider giving me a raise (her tone was seething).  After a good cry and some breathing to calm down, I crafted a kind and succinct response essentially just saying that I apologized if my asking to have the discussion was seen as overstepping but unfortunately if its not even on the table then I would have to give them my notice. She responded telling me I HAD BECOME TOO COMFORTABLE with their family and to come by this weekend with their car seat. She had many other unkind things to say that I don't need to say but I simply responded saying I understood and that I would be by with the car seat at a time convenient for them. I'm shaking in my boots because honestly I don't want to go back to their house, not knowing what I'd be walking into, It's also scary because now I'm scrambling to get interviews this weekend to try to fill the holes in my schedule. I feel like I am taking crazy pills over here, trying to understand how things went so sour and why she would act as if I was in the wrong and had become too comfortable with them even though I was always following her lead. Has anyone ever worked for someone like that? I'm just at a loss trying to find the logic here, any advice on how to go about returning the car seat???\n\n*EDIT* My partner was able to drop the carseat off for me, which I'm very appreciative of, he carried back the message that the husband feels apologetic, he would have given me more money but he is happy I can go find a better job being paid what I deserve! No word from the mom, and I hope it stays that way! Thank you all for your kind and supportive comments, I feel not so alone now and that means the world to me, I really thought I was loosing my marbles <3"

I don't see where she is even close to what you should be paid assuming six visits during the day would be the minimum. The two of you are too far apart. One visit here in IL is a minimum of $20 for travel and time and spending the night should be at least $75 in and of itself I would think.   We pay $175 a day for a seminary student to watch our house and walk our dogs when we go on vacation.  They stay in our home which is nice and all we have to do is provide food for the student.  Unless you really need the money, I'd tell her you'd love to pet sit for her but aren't able to commit to that schedule of on and off throughout the day plus spending the night over the 4th of July holiday. Working for that little of money could be a problem down the road when you want a raise for the routine services you provide for her.  If she can't get somebody for what she wants to pay, the dog will be perfectly fine. She can always board it for a fee of around $35 a day and that gets you out of having to tell her point blank that her expectations of what $60 a day entitles her to are totally unrealistic. By the time you got back home from walking her dog you'd have just enough time to get a snack for yourself and walk your own dog before you had to turn around and drive back over there."

	"text": "This was the latest email I received from them....then my response. It's long, sorry!!:)\n\n&nbsp; Hi Janelle,\nThank you for your email. I would be happy to assist you today! \n\n&nbsp;We greatly appreciate your opinion, and are always working to make sure our members are having the best experience possible with the site. I do apologize if you found our safety screening disappointing. We created this feature based on feedback from members just like you, and we will make sure to pass your experience and suggestions on to our Product Management team for review. We are always grateful when our members let us know if something isn\u2019t working well, or when they have an idea of how something could work better!&nbsp;\n\nWe realize this new fee may mean that some caregivers will not be able to continue on Care.com, but we believe this is an essential step toward a safer platform with fully engaged care providers. We also believe that a Care.com basic membership offers the best value of any care platform, including access to the most jobs across the country, the ability to build trust with families with a background check badge, and the ability to keep 100 percent of all wages earned.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;Our commitment to innovation is reflected in the ongoing advancement of our safety tools and features to improve trust and connectivity on the platform.&nbsp; These include a new coronavirus-related self-reporting feature now available on your profile.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;Safety on all fronts remains critical to building trust between families looking for care and the caregiving workforce. When engaged workers are easier to find, matches happen more quickly.\n\n&nbsp;If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to let me know or you can visit our&nbsp;Help&nbsp;page.\n\nBest Wishes,\nJenny\nCare.com Member Care\n\nMy response...\n\nThis is literally a slap in the face. You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. This is a money scheme and nothing more. Because I can guarantee that NO Caregiver on the site asked to have a required $15 fee to KEEP their account. If you guys were ACTUALLY listening to your Caregivers, the ones who bring you more account holders, you would read TONS of stuff on the site, community forum, that everyone is appalled by this FORCED fee. What they ARE asking for, is MORE safety for themselves. Where are the background checks for the families we are applying to?? We have NO IDEA what we're getting ourselves into when going to meet a family. Some of your CAREGIVERS on the site have been treated very poorly by families on your site. But do you even care about them?! No, you care about charging someone who is trying to make money, a FORCED fee, JUST for them to keep their account active. Let's get something straight as well, I'm not against a background check. I am against a FORCED fee for one, when there is NO GUARANTEE that I will find a job, or that MY safety is JUST as important as the families we are applying to. If a family that I apply to wants me to get a background check, then I would gladly get one, have before. But to make it an annual fee to KEEP my account, is highway robbery.\n\nIf you TRULY cared about a safer platform, like you claim, you would require your families looking for help, to also get the SAME background check. And to say that you are trying to get a 'safer platform with fully engaged care providers', is so disrespectful. To say that someone isn't 'fully engaged' because they don't want to pay an annual fee, that is a money scheme, is beyond rude. Again we are the ones that pass the word of mouth to other people. And again you mention, 'Safety on all fronts remains critical to building trust between families looking for care and the caregiving workforce'. It's a farce. Because it's not safety on all fronts, because this is totally one sided. When you require families looking for help to get a background check, then it will be 'On all fronts'. Until then, tell it like it is...'We are now charging an annual fee for our BASIC membership.' Be upfront, honest, and EQUAL on all fronts, and you'll have more memberships, and people actually trusting you.\n\nI will not be paying the fee, and I will NOT be recommending Care.com to anyone else. Will be doing the exact opposite actually. I've had 3 jobs through the site, since 2013. I used to tell everyone to go to Care.com, families looking for help, and caregivers looking for work. No more.&nbsp;\n\nGod Bless and have a nice day.\nJanelle"

I don\u2019t think any family should think, \u201coh but what if I cancel?\u201d Why would you cancel after asking me watch your kiddo(s)? It makes it seem like they\u2019re planning on canceling just because they have the option to without any repercussions and that\u2019s not ok. I don\u2019t think they should have the mentality that it\u2019s okay to cancel because she\u2019s going to let me roll it over to next time. Ummmm no!!! You\u2019re missing out on money that way and why would a family that value you be okay with taking possible income away from you?! \n\nYou got this! Stay firm and tell them after taking everyone of your clients opinions into consideration you\u2019ve decided that you will require a retainer fee that may not be rolled over. Now with that being said, don\u2019t tell them this but if a emergency arises in their family and they have to cancel on you then you could give them a one time pass to roll it over if you would like. Again it\u2019s you\u2019re decision."

Someone else had the brilliant idea to charge a booking fee which I\u2019m giving strong consideration to.\n\nBottom line: Guaranteed pay, cancellation fee, and (maybe) booking fee should be non-negotiable; if the family doesn\u2019t provide it, what\u2019s to stop them from cancelling and you missing out on work opportunity?  Absolutely nothing.  Get it in writing to make it legally binding. You are providing a service that requires compensation upon completion (or maybe even upfront) and deserve to be treated like a professional.  Unfortunately, too many families are oblivious to that fact which is why there are so many topics on caregivers being put in difficult positions thanks to their poor display of conduct/etiquette."

	"text": "Nanny tax procedures every family should know about\nUnsure of your responsibilities to your caregiver? Here's what the IRS wants you to do\n\n  \n 310 \nErik Johnson , Editor, Care.com HomePay\nnanny tax paper and calculator\nUpdated 2019-05-30\nIf you\u2019re hiring a nanny, you may have heard the term \u201cnanny taxes.\u201d But what exactly are they and are they applicable to you?\n \nYou should know: If you pay a nanny (or any other caregiver) $2,100 or more during the course of the calendar year, you must withhold taxes from their paychecks and pay your share of taxes as a household employer. Not only is it illegal if you don't, but it may also do your nanny a huge disservice. Your nanny is breaking the law, too when they\u2019re not reporting the wages they\u2019re earning from you. And not having proof of income can prevent them from qualifying for things like car loans and apartment rentals.\n \n\"I've had clients tell me they pay taxes simply because, in their profession, customers expect them to do things the right way,\u201d says Tom Breedlove, Sr. Director of Care.com HomePay. \u201cThey're not considered trustworthy if they do the opposite in their personal lives.\"\n \nWhat are the benefits of paying taxes for your nanny?\nYes, taxes add an extra cost to your care budget, but they\u2019re also important for your financial well-being. Here are a couple of the benefits of paying your nanny legally.\n \nFinancial security for your nanny \u2014 now and in the future. Having taxes withheld will ensure that your nanny can prove their work history, collect unemployment if you have to let them go and build credit with the Social Security Administration so they\u2019ll qualify for Medicare and Social Security payments upon retirement.\n \nPeace of mind for you. You may think that if you're not running for office, you'll never get caught not paying taxes. But it happens more often than you'd think. All it takes is for your former nanny to file for state unemployment benefits, which triggers the IRS to realize you've never paid household employment taxes. Or if the working relationship between you and your nanny sours and they file a wage dispute, your lack of tax payments could easily be brought to light.\n\nFind out if your industry is on the list of the Top 11 professions most at risk if not paying nanny taxes.\n \nHow much will I have to pay in nanny taxes?\nA good estimate is 10 percent of your nanny's gross wages, but this can vary by state. Social Security taxes are 6.2% and Medicare taxes are another 1.45%. The rest is made up of unemployment insurance taxes and any additional taxes your state may assess. Check the details in your state for more information.\n \nIf you'd like to run a specific budgeting scenario, check out our nanny tax calculator for a quick answer.\n \nAre there tax breaks to lower the cost of my nanny taxes?\nYes, there are two tax breaks most people can take to offset the tax liability you incur by hiring a nanny:\n \nDependent Care Account. Ask your employer if they offer a Dependent Care Account (a type of FSA) as part of your benefits package. This lets you set aside up to $5,000 of your annual income before taxes and then use that money to pay for child care expenses, such as your nanny\u2019s wages. Reducing your overall taxable income by $5,000 will reduce your tax burden. Your tax savings will depend on the tax bracket you're in, but most families save about $2,000 per year.\n \nChild Care Tax Credit. This lets you claim 20 percent of the first $3,000 you spend on child care if you have 1 child, or $6,000 if you have 2 or more children. This results in up to either $600 or $1,200 in savings. If you have one child, it\u2019s usually better to use a Dependent Care Account if you have access to it.\n\nIf you have 2 or more children, you can use both tax breaks! Your first $5,000 in child care expenses will go toward the FSA and an additional $1,000 can be put toward the child care tax credit. This saves you an additional $200.\n \nHow do I set up payroll for my nanny and start making tax payments?\nThe most efficient way to pay taxes on your household employees is to sign up with a payroll service like HomePay. For a quarterly fee, we'll direct deposit your nanny's paychecks to her bank account, withhold all appropriate taxes and file them electronically. If you\u2019re more of a DIY person, read our tips on how to pay nanny taxes yourself."

I have been with them for a while but I have decided that I am going to (finally) start college in January 2020 at a university that I didn\u2019t expect to get into but ended up being accepted!!.\nIt truly is bittersweet because I care for this family so much and they have been really good to me, they give me extra hours when I need them, pay me cash every Friday, offer me food and coffee. They truly are a really good family- I got very lucky ( I read horror stories all the time on here about how you guys have cameras watching you, or the dad is hitting on you, or you\u2019re not getting paid on time \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c) I have never dealt with anything like that.\nSo my question is.. because I am leaving the family is currently looking for a new nanny and asked if I could help search as well, so if you are in the Tucson area and are looking for a good full time position nannying a two year old, feel free to leave a comment so I can refer you to my current employers.\nIf I see any scams about \u201cbuy me a wheelchair before I can meet you\u201d you\u2019re getting blocked and reported.\nThanks guys! \ud83d\ude0a"

So, I try to avoid caring for kids with communicable illnesses like cold, flu, hand-foot-mouth, have lice and not fully treated, etc. In situations like these and the parents tell me before the care date, if I decide not to go, I will forfeit the care fee, correct? Because it's my choice to accept or not? Obviously if I myself cancel for any reason I expect nothing. Not trying to get free money but just trying to see how others handle situations like these.

Probably one of the most important things is that I care ONLY for infants & very few toddlers. That is where my years of experience are and what I prefer. I don\u2019t do any housework, no cooking,  no laundry (unless S. has a massive blowout!! I  may start each morning at home feeling \u201cblah\u201d\u2014tired\u2014just wanting to do nothing, but I get up\u2014put on my makeup & get dressed. (Yes, I do shower, but at night. lol) In the course of going through my morning routine, I give myself a little pep talk\u2014motivation to put my foot out the front door. I tell myself we are going to have the very best day possible and enjoy it. Example: Tuesday could have been a horrendous day. I was told to come in a couple of hours late because S. had her 6 month well visit, got three shots plus one oral. Needless to say, she was a grumpy Gus when she got home. To make it the best day possible, she got lots of extra loving, cuddles and singing (and you would pay me not to sing!!\ud83d\ude06). I have been caring for S since she was 7 weeks old\u2014-she was 6 months on the 15th. The Dad works from home, but I only see him if he comes downstairs for a cup of coffee or a snack\u2014some days I don\u2019t see him at all. Mom works from home and is an Assistant Professor. I\u2019m there to care for S while Mom grades papers, various big assignments and writes for publication. (She also manages to get a lot of housework done too.) After all of that\u2014-my daily goal is to make sure I take the absolute best care of and love sweet S. I also want to keep the family happy and try to make sure everyone has a great day. I leave whatever \u201cstuff\u201d that was running through their door and if it wasn\u2019t that big an issue I just leave. The Mom is a great lady....she never fails to thank me for all of the work I did that day. So, with that being said, I would think my longer term goal is to keep doing what I\u2019m doing, make any adjustments as needed, and love that precious baby.  I don\u2019t know if that helped or even answered your question, but once I get going I just run with it. Have a great day. Terri in SC"

They want a maid, and a nanny, and a family assistant.  All very different jobs.

Laundry (extra fee) etc. I provide childcare and will clean up only after the child. I'm not afraid to stand up for myself anymore thankfully. My time is valuable just like anyone else's and I'll charge accordingly! I've never had any complaints from my recent families despite my even higher rates. They spoil me and treat me well!"

It should either be free or we should have the option to pay a very small monthly fee up front that is only charged if we receive a minimum of 5 response msgs every month.  I personally charge a minimum of $25 per hour and I have to be guaranteed at least an hour and a half daily. Most of the services or agencies won't take a client less than 3 hrs a day. I apply to several jobs a week in my price range and rarely get more than a view of my profile. I'm older than most caregivers on here and I really thought that was why I didn't get more responses but after reading several of these posts I'm concluding that that may not be why I'm not getting more responses.

Now, care.com prefers that caregivers pay a monthly fee. If you don't pay the fee, some families can still view your messages if they are premium members. In addition, families can also scroll thru caregiver profiles on the care.com website and send you a message without you even applying for a job with them. \n\nI do not pay the monthly fee, and almost all of my jobs come from families who send me messages asking me to apply for their positions. If you are in need of immediate work for a long term position, I would suggest that you pay the monthly fee  long enough to find a job. If you are only seeking occasional babysitting jobs, it might be okay to not pay, but have a good profile and hope that prospective families contact you. You can also still apply for positions and if the family is a premium member, they will be able to contact you. You also need to check your care.com messages daily to see whether any families may have contacted you. I had 5 jobs last month and all of the families contacted me directly. I just received another message this morning for a position I did not apply for.\n\nGood luck!"

Just Google 'Private Payroll'.  You can YouTube private payroll as well.\n\nAnother consideration: If the employer does not have a tax ID number, you will never be able to file for unemployment if that should ever become necessary (many of us are now in that unfortunate boat because of Covid).\n\nAlso, when your employment is filed according to the IRS requirements, if your employer has a personal FLEX account (usually used for the family's health care expenses) he can arrange for your salary to be paid with his designated FLEX funds, which will make YOU a pre tax  expense to him...a great deal all around!\n\nAnd have a contract specifying duties, schedule, pay etc. Good luck.

I got a response and we ended up talking over the phone. \nIt turns out it\u2019s a dad with two kids and he has them sometimes and is looking to get someone to fill in for him. \nWhat I thought was weird was he said he would call me at 10:00am and didn\u2019t call until 11:15am, he called from a NY number, when we\u2019re in CA and the call kept breaking. He said he\u2019s heading to a meeting (on a Sat) but he wanted to chat for a few mins. He didn\u2019t really ask anything about myself or what I can do as a babysitter. And at the end of the short convo he said I have the job but didn\u2019t even tell\nme my rate. His rate in the ad was listed as $12-$25. Which I thought was weird because that is a big range and usually I see parents have an idea of how much they really want to pay. I told him my fee is $25 and he said it was fine. He said he would message me later today details for tonight. \nI\u2019m feeling a bit skeptical and don\u2019t know what I can do to ensure that this is real and not a scam. \n\nI wanted to contact Care.com to see if they can give me more insight but I don\u2019t see any option on the app. \n\nI would appreciate any advice."

	"text": "Hi Julie. I\u2019m sorry that you struggle financially. Do you have any sort of budget tool? Even just tracking all of your expenses and income on an excel spreadsheet is helpful for me. I highly recommend looking into some different apps to help you manage your budget and give you different options. My bank also has some budget tools. Looking at your budget and all money coming in and out is essential to start saving. Obviously, everyone\u2019s situation is different, but if you can cut costs here and there, even just small ones, and put the extra money in your savings account, that\u2019s better than nothing. Look for coupons for your favorite yogurt or snack food, or whatever, and put the money you save in the savings account. If you eat meat, maybe one week a month, you go meatless and save that money that you would have spent on meat. Put it directly in your savings. Do you get a coffee or fast food or a meal out every week? Maybe switch to every other week or once a month; it also makes it more special. Look at those \u201cextras\u201d you have and try to condense them, if possible. I don\u2019t know who you bank with, but my bank (Wells Fargo) has a setting that every time I use my debit card, $1 is deposited into my savings account. \nAlso, I do want to suggest you create a cancellation policy for any cancellations with less than 24, 48, or 72 hours notice. I don\u2019t have anything like that because I\u2019m a nanny with guaranteed hours, but I\u2019ve seen others say they charge full price if cancelled within 24 hours, and half price for 48 hours. or full price within 48 hours and half within 72 hours, or just full price within X number of days with no half prices, something like that. Did that make sense? \nI hope this helped, at least a little. Do you have any other questions or clarification? I\u2019d be happy to help you further if you\u2019d like (: Have a great weekend."

	"text": "He is on the autism spectrum and can get early intervention help and you can also get support on what to do, like sensory toys, how to divert, etc. My friend is a special ed teacher and ive watched 2 child on the spectrum. When you have the toolsets, like training yourself, it could be a life changing event helping make a child's life better while you are there at least. I agree if you are miserable leave. If you want to try to continue to there and are willing to work with the child there are very easy ways to help him once you find out what he likes, DIY toys so you aren't spending a lot of money if the father won't buy his child gifts. If he is willing to let you buy some nice things to try, do the Amazon shopping for him, and return what doesn't work. Not everything works for each child so you will find bumps in the road. It will be an amazing transformation when you see very simple things you do work for him. For instance I realized my boy needed something to constantly be in his pockets and he would then be so patient in lines or at a restaurant. I let him pick out himself what little toys he could fit in his pockets each time we need to go out. #1 you make the rule. #2 he picks them out so they are his choices. You do that every single time. It has to be a regime you do. #3 he plays with them and is content when you need it the most, like the grocery store or a restaurant. I've had so many people come up to my praising me on not have a tablet, iPad, gamer with him and use his imagination. I politely say thank you. They have no idea it's 1 of my survival tools! I also never, ever leave the house without a pad and tiny washable smell good markers. He picked out the smells he likes so that's the ones I carry. While I make a meal at their house I set up a few things next to \"his\" chair. Tanagrams, teeny, tiny Lego men in a sandwich baggie (easy clean up) and a 4 piece puzzle box. They are made by a lot of companies but Mellisa and Doug are very durable. The wooden box has a slider lid. Entertaing itself. It has 4 areas for the puzzles pieces. On the backs of each piece are symbols. Circles, squares, triangles, and diamonds. Each have their own slots. All the diamonds make 1 puzzle, circles make another, etc. Then when he puts them away he does the same. Circles here, diamond's there. Slide lid when done, put in its spot right next to where he sits. They are always there. He picks which things to play with and in each order. I also have another pad and smelly washable marker set. Lastly at his spot I have a placemats, 2 sided. 1 with numbers to 10 and the other side with the alphabet. At 1st he scribbled over the sides but as time went on he would know A and 2, etc. Then eventually trace out the numbers and letters so needless to say these \"tools\" have been right at the same spot for years now. These kids are very schedule oriented and need to also know where things are in the house. Every day my markers are here and the \"matching markers\" I like are here.  There are a ton of things that have to be refilled but never moved around the house so you have little areas around the house. They like to be in small places and hiddened. So under my desk on the 1st floor are books, the same cozy blanket the family washes when he sleeps, and a stuffed bears and 4 matchbox cars and a sippy cup I put water in. I get my homework done and he will play under there for an hour or better. On the 2nd floor I have a pop-up tent, the small size that fits over a twin bed. It has 5 soft blankets, 10 or better stuffed animals which he changes out when he wants, never me, another set of books he chooses and small sensory balls. When he needs \"me time' he goes in there and loves it. I can spiff up, run a load of laundry, etc. He doesn't like to be touched because he has a sensory disorder. It's nothing personal. We found 100% organic pjs, the softest I've ever touched. He wears them all the time unless we really push it. Then the deal is we go out in \"people clothes\" and he can change back into them when we get home. They have 10-20 so it's not like it's 1 pair with holes in them. They are long sleeved with the cuffs at the end so they don't flop around and the skinny leg time with the cuffs on the ankles so they never seem too long or flop when he walks. The look like your normal Xmas kids pjs just extra soft and he never realizes if they are too big because they are never too long for his arms or legs. If you find a clothing material he likes buy like the same shorts in 5 colors. The old school boy doesn't look like he only wears the same outfit everyday. He does but just in a variety of colors. Find what colors he is drawn to and buy things including clothing in those colors. The 4 year old has every red matchbox car I think ever made. He also loves the cases and very meticulously puts them in each little car slot, his way. We have these cube pouches. To clean the room its a snap. Everything just gets thrown into the pouches that arent his favorites. His favorite are on a bookshelf so he doesn't have to look for them in the pouches. Same sippy cups for instance so it's always his and always clean because you have 10 alike. Our schedule never changes. That's paramount.  If you know on Fridays that is park day after naps go to the park every Friday. If its raining load him up anyway. Go there take him out. He won't want to stay and you go home. The schedule doesn't change and it's his idea to go home. Give him choices you want him to choose from. Only 2. Do you want an apple or some grapes? He's 2 so he will point to what he wants or say it depending on his stage of speaking.  Usually the last one you say, like grapes will tend to be the choice made. So make sure it's 2 things you want him to eat or do or want. Don't say a popsicle or cookie if you don't want him to eat either. Make musical instruments for him. The old coffee can with rocks in it. Have him scribble paper and glue it on. Put rice in an old dry watter bottle. A must have is 4-5 water bottles filled with water, oil (any oil like olive oil, whatever is around in the kitchen)  and glitter. Make sure the bottles are small and sealed as tight as you can. A lot of simple DIYs work along with the hanging hammocks and so forth that closet money. And the teeny tiny Legos obviously you need bigger ones so he doesn't choke just add smaller ones as time goes buy if he wants to add or trade some out of the baggie by \"his\" chair he's in while he waits for food or whatever...your phone call to end. Nap time...weighted blankets, they will be able to squirm out when or if they get too hot. With the cotton clothes typically they like them even if they sweat. 1 child wants 5. They lay on him in certain directions he likes, sounds crazy, but he cant sleep without them that particular way so you may want to get more than one. Its 1 lb over 10% of their weight. So say 35 lbs. Order a 4lb blanket. 1 child likes heavier pillows. Just ordinary non allergic feather type pillows. They are heavier and mold to your body and scrunch up just right to lay your head on. He like 3 on him. He looks like he's going to suffocate but he arranges them so he has a triangular shape area you can see him through and he breathes just fine. If anyone wants more tips and tricks I like to call tools leave a message here and I can type up a way smaller conversation list of some others I know."

I was in your shoes too when I first started out, and it is most frustrating. \n\nIT IS SURE TO CHANGE! READ ON!\nBut I want you to know that it will change! You can\u2019t give up! care.com is amazing! And I want to help you and tell you what helped me and changed everything so that now the people are actually messaging me with job opportunities that I am able to choose from! I have met the most amazing families on there and have a very full schedule and love my jobs.\n\nI know that other fellow community members have responded to your posts so well with great and wise advice, so you may have already figured out by now how to improve and get jobs.  But I decided to tell my story and how it worked for me and to put my ideas on one post, hoping that others will add their ideas to this post and people who need help can refer to it, instead of them to be all over the place.\n\nMY BACKGROUND:\nI have been babysitting since sixth grade and love engaging and playing with all age groups of children. They have always been my greatest joy and I adore them! I have worked with children for years in teaching Sunday school class, and worked for many years as a teacher in a private church school, and as the head leader for many years of a Gems Girls Club (like Girls Scouts) for a church and in our community, among other things. I also am an energetic, seasoned mother of three children. I have been married for 34 years to my supportive husband. He took care of me for many years when I was chronically sick with Lupus and MS. I am much better now! I also love to cook meals for families and clean houses too. \n\nI also am on care.com as a mother looking for babysitters, so I know what the employers are looking for in a caregiver and who they pass right by! So I have some advice about that as well to share.\n\nMY TIPS:\nNow that you know something about my work and personal history, I would like to give you some tips about how I got started and how I finally received job responses! \n\nPOST THAT PHOTO AND VIDEO RIGHT AWAY! A MUST!!\nBut first, let\u2019s focus on signing up on care.com. First, you should have had no problem filling out general info and verifying your social networks, (If your social networks are not verified, someone who is looking for a babysitter is thinking, what does she not want me to see on her social media? Why is it not verified?), picking out a very clear frontal photo to post and then posting a video. Wait! I notice most people chose not to post a video! But I feel this is very helpful! I use the photo booth video setting on my computer and set it in front of me and click on video and talk away. Then post it. It gives parents an extra feel for your special personality and see a bit of who you really are!! And I don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t post photos. When I look for a babysitter to hire, do you know that I skip right over you when I do not see a picture! I want to see what you look like before I even ask you to come meet my child! You really need to post a profile picture! Ask a friend to help! \n\n\nTWEEK YOUR BIO TILL IT IS CLEAR AND HAS ALL THE IMPORTANT DETAILS BELOW!\nWork hard at posting a clear down-to-earth bio about you and your love for children and your work with them growing up or whatever your life bio is. It should include your education, your experience working with children, why you love babysitting or what you like to do when you are taking care of kids (crafts, outdoors, homework help, etc.), and then add a sentence about you to make it personal, maybe about a couple hobbies you have and important character traits, like dependability and patience. (Some of these ideas were from a post I have read previously on care.com. They have so many helpful tips on every subject that you can refer to on their site!!)\n\nRECORD YOUR WORK HISTORY, EVEN INDIVIDUAL NANNY JOBS AND BABYSITTING JOBS, AND ALL JOBS PERTAINING TO CHILDREN OR NOT!\nWork History was a hard one for me to put on paper since I have babysat for so many people mostly long ago who have come and gone and I wanted to use the ones I wrote down as references for prospective employers to be able to call. But I came up with plenty, even from highschool days, and I know the people to this day. I didn\u2019t call all of them, but would have if I needed to. I also recorded the other work history mentioned pertaining to working with children and in the comments, I wrote about my unrelated jobs working at a bank, Dr\u2019s office, and dentist\u2019s office for years. \n\nSAFETY VERIFICATIONS: A MUST-HAVE!\nI think this is worth every penny to pay for to have on file. Parents always want this verified before they even consider you as their nanny or sitter. The money you spend for this will pay for itself when you get lots of jobs! They will come!\n\nKEEP YOUR AVAILABILITY CURRENT!\nI notice that it is pretty common that not many people keep up with this feature. It is very helpful if you do keep this up-to-date for the parents looking for babysitters! It doesn\u2019t take but a minute!\n\nAPPLICATIONS SHOULD BE A FRESH, CREATIVE, PROFESSIONAL MESSAGE FROM YOU EXPLAINING WHY YOU ARE RIGHT FOR THE JOB, INCLUDING THINGS BELOW! \nI highly suggest that you do not send the bio to the employer as your application!!! I get this all the time when I am looking to hire a babysitter. Boring!! Not personal at all! Lazy, in fact! It is annoying to receive the same thing as your bio, when you are asked to write the following:\n\u201cWrite a professional message explaining why you are right for the job. Mention your skills, work history, certifications, and anything that makes you stand out!\u201d \nBut, not many do this! That sentence is written by care.com on the application page! That is what they want you to write about on the application.\nI think it is pretty cut and dry and self-explanatory as to what to add to your application. And yes, they will see your bio too. Always proofread it and have someone correct your grammar and spelling. It is so unappealing. \n\n\u201cFOLLOW-UP\u201d in a couple days to see if they have hired anyone, and re-state why you are a good fit for the job,\u201d care.com suggests in one of their helpful articles on line. \u201cThey may have just forgotten you in the shuffle of applications flowing in!\u201d\n\nALSO, DON\u2019T FORGET TO:\n\nBE AMONG THE FIRST TO APPLY!\nBE PERSISTENT!\nRESPOND BACK BY THE MESSAGE DEADLINE!\nWHEN YOU DO GET A MESSAGE, AND THEY REQUEST AN INTERVIEW, BE ON TIME!!!\n\nSAMPLE APPLICATION:\n\nGood Morning, Kathy R,\n\nI was so excited when I read your job description! I just love working with your child\u2019s age group. I have been working with four to six year-olds for five years now at a kindergarten in my  town. I enjoy engaging the children in play, doing age-appropriate crafts, playing outside activities, teaching them in class, and so much more! \nI finished college with a business degree. I have CPR training, do not smoke, and have my own car.\nChildren of all ages bring me great joy! I also have experience babysitting for children of all ages for at least 10 years. \nI love to hike, swim, and draw. I would love to meet you and your child. I am dependable and patient and kind-hearted. I believe that I would be a great help to you with my experience. I have plenty of references that you can refer to. I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you for your time! \n\nRespectfully, \nSuzie Y.\n\n(I am no expert!! This is just my opinion and my attempt to help. Nothing is set in stone! Everyone has their own brilliant and creative way of writing. I just wanted to give a brief idea of what to write.)\n\nREVIEWS:\n\nTo me, this was the most important category that finally got the ball rolling and things happening for me on care.com! I think that these reviews are the #1 things parents look for on the the site! They are eager to see what people are saying about an applicant. If there are good reviews that say that their children love their sitter, that the sitter is reliable, and other good things, then they are going to message him/her over above someone with no reviews, for sure!\n\nSome have said how hard it is to get reviews. I thought that too. But I began asking people I babysat for in highschool! I even just asked people I have just been friends with for a long time or family friends who know my character, and who know how much I love children and how well I care for them and what kind of a devoted friend and loving mother I am. These people were thrilled to send a message to care.com. \n\nThere is a link you can send to their email, if you feel funny asking them verbally. The link asks them, and they send the link with their review back to your profile! VERY easy! I even put my profile on my facebook timeline. There is a link that promotes you and your care.com profile. Look for it on your page to do yourself! That may help you to get some babysitting jobs. I even posted it on all the local cities\u2019 support groups and market places and did get a few responses from there. This all gave me a good start. I would ask everybody I could think of for a review! \n\nBefore long, I started to get a handful of reviews dribbling in! I was so grateful, because soon after that, I received a couple messages, and the responses to my applications started to come! I was so excited. Time went on, and the reviews kept coming in, and I applied for more jobs and began to even be messaged by people looking for care! \n\nBut, once in a great while, the cycle stops for a short time. This, to me, means that I need to change things up a bit! Perhaps change my photo and make it more up-to-date! Or, tweek my bio a bit more! Change some wording and add some more creativity. Update my availability, check my work history and make sure I have added any new people that I have recently worked for on care.com too! \n\nBe sure to always ask the people you work for that have hired you from care.com for a review even after a good month of working for them. I know by then what I think about my new sitter and whether I think she is going to please me and be dependable or not and I know exactly what to say! I love writing reviews for my sitters. It is an honor. So don\u2019t be afraid to ask. On your profile, there is a place for you to just click on their name and request a review! Very simple!\n\nBENEFITS OF PREMIUM!\nA question a lot of you had was the question whether to pay for premium so you can be in the Pro care category, which is the top category on care.com. I have to say yes for sure, because if you don\u2019t, you will miss out on the full benefits of the site. Here are the benefits:\nYour profile will appear higher than others in the search results; you will be notified of jobs sooner than everyone else; You can see families who have not posted jobs yet; you will have multiple payment options; you can communicate with no conditions attached, etc. etc. You won\u2019t have to do this for too long, only till you get the jobs you need! Sometimes, a lower-paying monthly fee plan is offered out of the blue! So be checking for that on your page.\n\nDON\u2019T GIVE UP!\nMost of all, don\u2019t get discouraged! Be encouraged by the ones like me that go before you that started out JUST LIKE YOU!! We had to apply to tons of apps too, my friends, and go through the longgg agonizing days of waitingggg. But to me, it was not that bad at all. It was worth the efforts. And suddenly, it all comes together and yes! One day, it will happen!! You will jump for joy at that first new job, work it, and then get that great review! That review will lead to more and more!! Mark my words. Don\u2019t give up!! Thank you for reading my post and I surely hope even a bit of it has helped in some way.\n\n\n\nHERE ARE MY TIPS IN A NUTSHELL! \nIF YOU DO THESE CORRECTLY, I BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL GET RESPONSES AND JOBS!\n\n1.POST A CLEAR, FRONTAL PHOTO OF YOU WITH A SMILE! PARENTS WANT TO SEE YOU!\n2. MAKE A VIDEO! IT HELPS!\n3. VERIFY SOCIAL MEDIAS!\n3. TWEEK YOUR BIO WITH YOUR WORK EXP, EDUC, CHILDCARE EXP, PERSONAL  \n    TOUCHES, ETC.\n4. RECORD WORK HISTORY WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS- GO WAY BACK IF YOU HAVE    \n    TO, INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL NANNY JOBS!\n5. KEEP YOUR AVAILABILITY UP-TO-DATE!\n6. KEEP APPLICATIONS ORIGINAL, PERSONAL AND FULL OF HELPFUL INFO.\n7. ASK EVERYONE YOU KNOW WELL FOR REVIEWS AND EVERYONE YOU EVER WORKED  \n    FOR AND NOW WORK FOR! THIS IS YOUR ACE IN THE HOLE!\n8. PAY FOR PREMIUM! IT IS WORTH IT!\n\nNOW PLEASE ADD YOUR TIPS AND ADVICE BELOW ON HOW TO GET FAMILIES TO RESPOND TO APPLICATIONS! WHAT DO YOU THINK I LEFT OUT? PLEASE ADD!!! THANK YOU!!"

I don\u2019t mind tidying the house but not scrubbing. No baths unless it\u2019s care after 7pm.

I started working with them since January, before their daughter was even born so they would get to know/trust me. While they were still pregnant I came over and helped around the house and set up the nursery, for $8 an hour. I had zero problems with that since I was just helping out and didn\u2019t have a child to watch. Now they have raised me to $11 an hour after asking for higher pay 3 times. They make me do all of their laundry dirty&clean, do all of their dishes, wipe down counter tops and take out trash everyday. Every other day, I have clean their two stoves, vacuum the whole house including stairs and bedrooms, water plants and whatever else is asked of me. They made me take out my nose ring. They also are making me wear scrubs because my jeans were \u201cto tight\u201d and showed my bottom half and made the husband uncomfortable. I am also required to have my hair up at all times and not have any makeup on. \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do!? I have talked to them multiple times about how I feel and they have laughed at me, actually laughed. I feel so bad for wanting to quit because of how busy their lifestyle is and the attachment I have with their baby. I am also moving in January/February to Texas. So I fee as if I should stuck it up since I wont be there for too much longer. I just feel taken advantage of. Am I wrong for feeling this way? What should I do?"

I charged both families separately and the only reason I did that was because if you are going to charge one family your set price and then add an additional price for the other children how is that fair for the other family to only pay say $5 an hour but the first family is paying $15 and hour (or what ever you charge an hour and your additional fee for additional children) you have to remember this is more responsibility, more children to watch and make sure they are safe that means more pay. Both parents are responsible for their children and they should both be paid separately."

After all, remember, they need you, you do not need them. Make sure they pay you on Fridays and if they do not pay you make sure it is in your contract that they pay you on each Friday.  If they pay late, there will be a late fee of $50.00 for each day that they do not pay you. Let them know you are a business women and taking care of their most prized possession. You are a professional. God Bless You."

If she does not contact you by your specified date, you can go to your local courthouse to file a small claims case in civil court. You will need to pay a fee to file, but you can claim the court cost on your claim. Basically you would be suing for unpaid wages and the court cost that you pay for. You need to prove your case by having a contract or pay stubs to show that you worked for her and were paid by her that first week. You only worked for her for one week so you do have a long record of working for her, so it might be difficult to prove your hours and pay if you did not have a written agreement. There's no guarantee that you would win your case, but you can try if you want to spend the time and money on the court cost. You do not need a lawyer. You can argue your own case."

	"text": "So about two weeks ago i was contacted about my pet sitting services. the couple needed care for their animals while they were away - a dog, 3 kittens and 5 ducks. their home is about 40 minutes from my home but since it was only once a day, I wanted to make it work. After all I am trying to build my clientele and figured this would be good for me to do. The woman and I had several phone conversations as she was trying to negotiate my hourly rate. I explained that the distance was a factor but not a deal breaker, that my rate was the best I could offer and I would COMPLETELY understand if she found someone closer.  We had good convos the next few times we spoke.  She called me a week later and asked what my rate would be if she had another person take care of the dog. again I explained it had nothing to do with the number of animals but with distance. She said she understood and that I seem\nlike a great fit and then asked me to come meet with her and the animals the next day. (The first time I drive to a clients home I have my husband drive me- just to be safe. This way if I get the job he knows where they live in case of any issues. he stays in the car.) After meeting with her and the animals, she explained what I would need to do, where all food for different animals were kept, where to place the gathered duck eggs, etc., about 30 minutes later as I am walking out, she tells me where the keys would be kept and she would call me to let me know which day exactly she will be driving out of town. After all the communication- driving there and back (nearly 4 hours of my time), she Texts me the next day and she tells me her boyfriend decided not to go with her on vacation so my services are not needed at this time.  has anything similar happened to any of you?? she also mentioned she is \u2018not really a member\u2019 of care.com that she just trolls looking for help but doesnt want to pay the fee. my question is this: can anyone just join to search for caretakers? and i can only assume you are on your own as far as getting paid..... This is very new to me, just looking for some feedback. THANKS EVERYONE!"

	"text": "Nanny tax procedures every family should know about\nUnsure of your responsibilities to your caregiver? Here's what the IRS wants you to do\n\n  \n 310 \nErik Johnson , Editor, Care.com HomePay\nnanny tax paper and calculator\nUpdated 2019-05-30\nIf you\u2019re hiring a nanny, you may have heard the term \u201cnanny taxes.\u201d But what exactly are they and are they applicable to you?\n \nYou should know: If you pay a nanny (or any other caregiver) $2,100 or more during the course of the calendar year, you must withhold taxes from their paychecks and pay your share of taxes as a household employer. Not only is it illegal if you don't, but it may also do your nanny a huge disservice. Your nanny is breaking the law, too when they\u2019re not reporting the wages they\u2019re earning from you. And not having proof of income can prevent them from qualifying for things like car loans and apartment rentals.\n \n\"I've had clients tell me they pay taxes simply because, in their profession, customers expect them to do things the right way,\u201d says Tom Breedlove, Sr. Director of Care.com HomePay. \u201cThey're not considered trustworthy if they do the opposite in their personal lives.\"\n \nWhat are the benefits of paying taxes for your nanny?\nYes, taxes add an extra cost to your care budget, but they\u2019re also important for your financial well-being. Here are a couple of the benefits of paying your nanny legally.\n \nFinancial security for your nanny \u2014 now and in the future. Having taxes withheld will ensure that your nanny can prove their work history, collect unemployment if you have to let them go and build credit with the Social Security Administration so they\u2019ll qualify for Medicare and Social Security payments upon retirement.\n \nPeace of mind for you. You may think that if you're not running for office, you'll never get caught not paying taxes. But it happens more often than you'd think. All it takes is for your former nanny to file for state unemployment benefits, which triggers the IRS to realize you've never paid household employment taxes. Or if the working relationship between you and your nanny sours and they file a wage dispute, your lack of tax payments could easily be brought to light.\n\nFind out if your industry is on the list of the Top 11 professions most at risk if not paying nanny taxes.\n \nHow much will I have to pay in nanny taxes?\nA good estimate is 10 percent of your nanny's gross wages, but this can vary by state. Social Security taxes are 6.2% and Medicare taxes are another 1.45%. The rest is made up of unemployment insurance taxes and any additional taxes your state may assess. Check the details in your state for more information.\n \nIf you'd like to run a specific budgeting scenario, check out our nanny tax calculator for a quick answer.\n \nAre there tax breaks to lower the cost of my nanny taxes?\nYes, there are two tax breaks most people can take to offset the tax liability you incur by hiring a nanny:\n \nDependent Care Account. Ask your employer if they offer a Dependent Care Account (a type of FSA) as part of your benefits package. This lets you set aside up to $5,000 of your annual income before taxes and then use that money to pay for child care expenses, such as your nanny\u2019s wages. Reducing your overall taxable income by $5,000 will reduce your tax burden. Your tax savings will depend on the tax bracket you're in, but most families save about $2,000 per year.\n \nChild Care Tax Credit. This lets you claim 20 percent of the first $3,000 you spend on child care if you have 1 child, or $6,000 if you have 2 or more children. This results in up to either $600 or $1,200 in savings. If you have one child, it\u2019s usually better to use a Dependent Care Account if you have access to it.\n\nIf you have 2 or more children, you can use both tax breaks! Your first $5,000 in child care expenses will go toward the FSA and an additional $1,000 can be put toward the child care tax credit. This saves you an additional $200.\n \nHow do I set up payroll for my nanny and start making tax payments?\nThe most efficient way to pay taxes on your household employees is to sign up with a payroll service like HomePay. For a quarterly fee, we'll direct deposit your nanny's paychecks to her bank account, withhold all appropriate taxes and file them electronically. If you\u2019re more of a DIY person, read our tips on how to pay nanny taxes yourself."

If there\u2019s six long-haired dogs and cats in the house, obviously vacuuming is going to be a lot more difficult. But if it\u2019s a person who keeps their animals groomed daily and vacuums all the time, it wouldn\u2019t be that bad. The allergist told me I should have my ceiling fans cleaned every week, and I shouldn\u2019t do it myself. Those kinds of extras are time consuming, so they\u2019re the sort of things you\u2019ll have to tack on a little extra for."

Even non-paying parent members will be able to see and respond to your messages if you pay. But on the other hand, parents were too cheap to pay the fee for membership when looking for help are generally going to be really cheap about what they will pay."

Despite loss of income, during this time I recommend refraining from enforcing the standard early cancellation fees. Voluntary resignation may also void the legal right to a cancellation fee, I suspect? Live and learn. \n\nI own a local childcare LLC and chose to let go of fees and provide refunds. I will recoup revenue via small business grants, loans and unemployment insurance - not by extracting fees from a client. While the client IS technically on the hook for the fee, my reputation is more valuable. If you enforce cancellation fees during COVID-19, you pay the very high price of a negative reputation, poor review, and no reference to any other parents your client knows. Self-employed and contractors are eligible for very decent unemployment insurance at this time. It is a very difficult time for us all - take care."

	"text": "Am pretty sure we can't message with a family posting a job we applied to unless they have paid for a premium account or are willing to upgrade to one.... presumably when they are notified by Care.com that someone has applied to their ad.  Very frustrating being as how the last 4 families I just applied to this morning were not Premium account holders and I couldn't find out they hadn't paid for a premium account entitling them to communicate freely with me until after I applied to their post. The icon/badge that tells us whether a user is a premium account holder or not does NOT appear anywhere in a user's profile with the exception of  the messages area (again, only after an application is submitted) and.... I'm pretty sure that's by design at this point. Again, very frustrating because I would prefer to only spend time composing applications to users who are premium users who will be able to respond to me.  Incidentally, this restriction of communication until a user is willing to \"pay to play\" appears to be a two way street. If a care provider is not paying for a premium account, a person looking for a care provider won't be able to message us even if they are paying for a premium account.  Regarding our profiles/ads, apparently Care.com will not approve any ad or any profile that includes a phone number. I've tried.... as a premium user.... to edit my profile to include my phone number to be in a position to reach out to the basic/free users who can only read my profile and at least 4x it was not approved. Care is evidently not going to ever permit even a premium user from  disclosing their phone number in their profile or ad presumably because they must be using our applications and ads as an enticement to get basic users to pay to upgrade to a premium account. As a premium user who would like to better be able to manage my time when submitting applications, I find this practice to be a disservice to me and would appreciate it if someone from Care.com found a work around for it. Quite frankly, I would be willing to pay an extra fee just to be able to communicate with basic account members or to be permitted to place my phone number in my profile which... appears to be able to be viewed by both basic and premium account holders. Let's face it, some users just aren't going to upgrade to a premium account no matter how many applications they receive.... they'll go to Craigslist or sittercity.com which is a shame because Care.com really does attract a lot of users.  I'm afraid it's down to the submission of Care.com applications being the law of large numbers..... premium care providers just have to keep renewing their subscriptions submitting one application after the next until we stumble on users posting jobs who paid for a premium subscription. Unfortunately, the vast majority of people signing up appear to be basic/free users which is of little use to me.  Also.... it's doubtftul users can post reviews unless they are premium account holders. If a user posting a job was a premium user for say..... one week or one month but didn't renew because they hired someone, I don't think that user can post a review unless they pay to upgrade to premium again. Would be nice if someone from Care.com chimed in on that. Hope what I learned after contacting Care.com's customer support yesterday is helpful to others."

Not everyone is in a situation where they have extra money laying around; many, many people live paycheck to paycheck. That doesn\u2019t make you irresponsible. Just talk to her and tell her you\u2019re really needing to be paid Thursday nights again so you can take care of your financial responsibilities.

I suggest that you have a contract that states all of your specific duties and details of your position, so that there's no confusion to you or the parents, then everyone will know what to expect. You mentioned that you receive no benefits. If you want benefits with your position, that should be negotiated before you're hired. I hope you can talk to the mother about your concerns. Please don't let her take advantage of you. It's a lot of work to take care of children and clean the house. You're a nanny, you need to focus your time and energy on the children."

Meaning : take the time to write an authentic application to each family you respond to. \n\nI don't waste my time applying to posts that are cookie cutter Care.com type posts and I suggest you do the same if you are trying to make a significant amount of money. Affluent families take the time to complete an entire profile, with a picture and a detailed description of their family and care situation they are hoping to create. I might be wrong about that every so often, but all of the positive work situations I've encountered with Care, the employers have taken the time to create an in-depth profile and they have paid for the premium membership instead of me.\n\nLastly, 5 star references on your profile are a major selling point. So, if you don't have anyone to write some for you now then try to get some date night or short term gigs and have those people start writing you references.\n\nAlso, if you have a nanny agency in your town you might have better luck connecting with affluent families. Typically nannies don't pay anything to the agency, it's the families who pay the agency a finding fee.\nGood luck!"

	"text": "Completely in agreement with Emma about charging hourly instead of a flat rate.  They say an hour and a half, but you never know.  I recently did a date night/wedding job where the family said they wouldnt be out late, probably no later than 9-ish, because it was a distant relative's wedding and they didn't really know anyone. Well, apparently they had a better time than they'd thought they would because they didn't get back until after midnight!  And that is why I always charge hourly.\n\nFind out as much as you can before giving them a rate: how many families, if each family is planning on paying or if your normal employer is planning on covering it, etc.  \n\nI still think that since you're dealing with multiple families you should treat it like a nanny share and charge each family per hour ($10-$12 per hour per family, depending on the number of kids each family has)\n\nYou can ask them how they normally handle it, but just because others have agreed to something doesn't mean you have to if you feel that arrangement isn't worth it for the amount of work you'll be doing.\n\nI just hope they don't think they can pay your usual rate or only a couple dollars over your usual rate for that great of a workload increase!\n\nHorrible babysitting story, that's thankfully not mine:  Once my sister was invited to a wedding with no children allowed and a friend of hers offered her normal date night sitter's services to all her friends and said they could all split her normal $12 an hour fee between them.  I can't imagine what happened when that poor woman showed up to what she thought was a normal date night job to find a house full of kids and a group of parents who thought they could each pay her $1-$2 dollars an hour!  I imagine it wasn't pretty and my sister's friend no longer had a date night babysitter after that.  \n\nAt least your family has told you about this and isn't just bringing in a bunch of extra kids and expecting you to watch them--but you never know what they're thinking as far as pay so just make sure you're not taken advantage of!"

	"text": "Ok, so I do flat rate overnight (8 hours) if kids sleep through, and I charge hourly if they\u2019re awake enough that I can\u2019t get 5 hours consecutive sleep.\n\nLocation is huge with this.  For someone I like who I know is on a shoestring budget, I split the difference between the going rate and minimum wage.  DC is $15/hour, Florida is $8.56/hour, so knowing which state you\u2019re in is essential.\n\nSo, for your question of how much to charge for 5pm to 10am, I\u2019m going to go with Florida  ($8.56 minimum, $16/average) and DC ($15 minimum, $25 average), and I\u2019m going to run it for both kids sleeping through (flat rate) and kids needing me (hourly).  Flat rate is (for me) roughly 50-67% of what the 8 hours would be, rounded to the nearest multiple of $25.\n\nFL (helpful) rate: around $12.25\nDC (helpful) rate: $20\n\nHours (flat): 5-10pm + 6-10am = 9 hours\nHours (hourly): 5pm-10am = 17 hours\n\nFlat fee (FL): 12.25 x 8 = $98, so $50 is flat fee\nFlat fee (DC): 20 x 8 = $160, so $75 is flat fee\n\nPay (flat ) = rate x hours+ flat\nPay (FL, flat) = 12.25 x 9 + 50 = 110.25 + 50 = $160.25\nPay (DC, flat) = 20 x 9 + 75 = 180 + 75 = $255\n\nPay (hourly) = rate x hours\nPay (FL, hourly) = 12.25 x 17 = $208.25\nPay (DC, hourly) = 20 x 17 = $340\n\nAs you can see, there are a variety of factors.  Use your basic formula for pay and rate (Pay = rate x up to 40 + rate x overtime x 1.5) and add a flat fee instead of 8 hours if you can sleep through."

But, if it\u2019s lateness in terms of not paying you every Friday for example, then I charge $20 for each 24hr lateness.\n\nNope! Don\u2019t do a flat rate. You need to be paid hourly or don\u2019t take the job. Same thing for hourly rate and half is above 40hrs. \n\nI don\u2019t do housekeeping at all. I only offer to cook for the kids, and do the dishes for the items I will use for the kids and clean after the kids for any messes they will make during my presence. Therefore, I cannot tell you how much to charge for housekeeping since these 2 are separated jobs and it\u2019s worth more $$ to be either a childcare provider or a housekeeper instead of combining them. \n\nNope!

When I get there they wanted me to deep clean all house windows wash windows in and out all sliding doors in and out this is a bug house mind you. Double scrub heavily grease soiled kitchen cabinets and scrub gum out of their living room floors. Pretty much the works... I should have had more guts to nip it in the bud and tell him I will have to charge more than $20.. Not including the very dirty bathrooms. So I end up staying 12 hours and he only paid me $220.00 dollars. He didn't pay me the extra hour. I decide to let this go because I am goid natured and sometimes A push over. A few days later he calls me again wanting me to work a couple hours for his other rental home doing basic cleaning. So i agree and show up, and he switched up on me saying he wanted me to change bedding and 4 large beds. Clean 2 very dirty bathrooms. Clean all windows and sliding doors and spot clean cabinets. Also wanted me to clean the kitchen cabinets windows, in and out the fridge, throw away old food, and dining room and living room. Sweep and mop and wash all dirty linens ..on top of it his wife was rushing me saying \"hurry up\" and they wanted me to get this done in 2 hours no more than 3... Ugggh I finally had enough and told him i will no longer do business with them. And they still owe me $40 dollars extra fee for changing bed sheets and the hour he owed me from going over time... He has not responded to my texts... Hes been ignoring me... Idk if I should just take this as a learning experience... Any advice or comments are welcomed. Thanks for hearing my rant. :("

There have been multiple deaths of children under the age of 1.  As well the rape of  a 7 year old girl, and many other children who have been abused because of the manipulative, sneaky and dangerous individuals who take advantage of this platform. A simple google search will inform you why it is so important that we advocate for these children. Honestly im nervous my account will be removed after i make this post. \n\n1. Care.com babysitter Sarah Gumm was convicted of murder and sentenced to 23 years in jail for beating a 3-month-old to death. Prior to registering on Care.com she had two DUIs, a \u201cbattery incident,\u201d and a felony charge \u2014 all of which went undetected by Care.com\u2019s background check.\n\n2. Care.com babysitter Sarah Cullen was convicted of murder and sentenced to 70 years in jail for killing a 4-month-old child. She had a DUI prior to registering on Care.com.\n\n3. Care.com babysitter Aisling McCarthy Brady had no prior criminal history prior to registering on Care.com, but had overstayed her visa. A one-year-old died in her care. She was found not guilty in a criminal charge, but the family was later awarded $4 million in a new lawsuit.\n\n4. On March 2018, Care.com babysitter Jonathan Tavara-Nima was sentenced to 25 years for raping a seven-year-old girl he met on Care.com. Care.com said his account \u201cwould be removed and blacklisted.\u201d Care.com didn\u2019t mention that he had been arrested for child pornography charges five years earlier.\n\n\nThis is for the real nannies, the ones who live and breath for the finger painting, for the peppa pig songs, for the cuddles, for the ones who choose to advocate for children. Some how some way we do need a change to this platform so the children will be safe\n\npeace &amp; love"

I\u2019ve never had a issue with cashing a check and it bouncing but if it was to happen I would charge a return fee as well as expect payment in full for the amount of the bounced check. It\u2019s in my contract that I expect this and I make all my families sign a contract. I also require my families to pay me at the beginning of the week the agreed upon amount of hours so I do not have to worry about someone not paying me or worry about having to have the talk amount cancellation of hours on the part of families. You could also get paid via electronically and could wait till you received the confirmation before leaving. \n\nI would say to not count cash in front of your client because I could see how it could be insulting. He clearly thinks it\u2019s inappropriate and I would just apologize to him then make sure to not do it again. Count it when you get to the car. If the amount is incorrect then immediately bring it to his attention and do not provide services till he gives you the correct amount."

That must have been upsetting and disappointing for you. \nHonestly, I understand that financially  this is a difficult time of year for many people, including some of the families we work with, but that is no excuse to not pay you. You make their kids a priority when you're caring for them, so they should make you a priority and pay you on time after you've done so much for them. Text your employer again and ask when you can expect your payment for the hours and job you've completed. Send her the dates, hours, and total due. I hope she responds soon and you get your full payment. When your next contract comes up, consider implementing a late fee. Good luck, Bry. \nHappy Holidays!\n\ud83d\ude0a Kelly K"

Before that happened, I actually loved it and I hold on to those good memories. The important thing is that I learned from it. If you do decide to, try to go through an agency. They can help prevent it and help mediate if it does happen. Other things I\u2019ll quickly list is to get a contract with as much details as possible, especially with working hours. Flexibility is often needed as a live-in but there HAS to be boundaries so you\u2019re not just at their beck and call. Whatever you do, don\u2019t take a salary. Only charge hourly. It\u2019s a good rule of thumb for every nanny, but especially live-in. If they need you to be available for just in case times, you should be paid an on-call fee. Just because you live there, doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have a life and deserve freedom and rest. Lastly, don\u2019t let them give you a significant pay cut. If you do decide to, only go down like $2 max. I took a significant one and regret it.

I can\u2019t see how they expect you to sit and stare at a sleeping baby in a dark room for up to 1.5 hours!! That\u2019s like sitting around and watching paint dry. You could suggest they use a sleep sack for the baby to sleep in. It\u2019s basically a little jacket type thing that zips their hands, arms, legs and feet all inside. The baby won\u2019t need a loose blanket and she won\u2019t be able to pull anything into her face, eliminating the risk of suffocation. Quite a few parents I have babysat for have used sleep sacks for their babies newborn-2 years old! It gives you the peace of mind for safety while they sleep. \n\nIs 14/hr the minimum babysitting rate in FL? Here in TX it\u2019s $10/hr! I would ask for a raise solely on the idea that you are now doing housework for them. You were hired on at $14 only to care for the baby. You don\u2019t mind doing small house chores IF you are compensated for it! I would not go pick up/deliver their meals anymore unless they pay you a specific fee. Anytime they require you to go do that, it could be $20? Or whatever rate you feel like it should be. Otherwise they could just use a food delivery service (waitr, uber eats..)

They also pay me the hours when They come home early without hesitation. There is many people in the neighborhood who congratulate them for choosing me as their caregiver and They feel great knowing that I represent them perfectly.

Like let\u2019s say my minimum fee was $13/hr, and a family explained it was one night and an emergency, and they didn\u2019t have that kind of money. THEN negotiations can happen, but please don\u2019t set your rate outside of your comfort zone to please a potential client. These one time exceptions can turn into long term commitments very quickly, and being underpaid frequently can damage your mental health. learn how to weigh these opportunities in your own mind and pick your battles. Your time is valuable because you may have 5 appointments that are underpaying you, that are filling up your appointment slots where you would be making more than or equal to your minimum hourly fee. It\u2019s just scary to me knowing how there may be a naive high school student who would take that rate to avoid losing a client."

	"text": "6 months ago I started a job with a very nice family. However the mom always wants to be right in everything and everything has to be done how she wants it. She tells me what to do in everything. For example, she pick out the baby\u2019s clothes in the morning, for him to wear throughout the day. Sometimes though, the baby spits up badly or has a diaper accident and I have to change his clothes. When I tell her we have to change the baby she tells me I can pick out the new clothes. I go and change his clothes I put on a decent outfit, when she sees him she says \u201cnot that outfit\u201d \u201clet pick out something different\u201d. Then a couple days later she picks out the outfit I had picked out and she didn\u2019t like. Another example: one of the baby\u2019s sock is falling of she notices and says his sock is about to fall off. So I go and try to either fix it or take his socks off and she\u2019ll say \u201cjust leave it, let it fall on it\u2019s own\u201d. So I back up and leave it, as soon as I do that she say \u201cno let\u2019s take them off\u201d. She also tells her husband what to do and when to do it, if he doesn\u2019t she gets mad with everyone and she starts complaining about how stressed out she is. Sometimes their 5year old daughter is telling me something when the mom is not in the room and she comes in fast asking what we are talking about, (it could be about preschool, her favorite food/color conversation) she also does it when I\u2019m in the kitchen talking to her husband, she storms in asking what we are talking about. She tells me when to sit when to drink my coffee etc. Sometimes it\u2019s unbearable."

I also want the child to be comfortable with me and if they are toddler size I want them to show me their room,  I want them to know that I'm somebody they can trust and I also want to understand the whole family dynamic. I do not meet people at coffee shops Etc. If they want me to babysit, they give me their address and I go to their home. Now on the back side, I also look up their address to see if it matches their name on Google. Simple easy quick background of relative easy information. I also may do a search on their phone number after talking with them. I want to see that there's some honesty there and that I don't have anything to worry about. Does that make sense? That was a long answer to your short question. Always meet the kids. Always Meet the Parents. Always see the family Dynamic. And always know that kids pick up on everything. So they will see that the parents are comfortable with you or not comfortable."

I rarely see videos on profiles, and those are so important to parents. And everyone should have a profile picture. As a parent, I skip right over those. I would not ask someone in my home for an interview who I have no idea what they even look like and who can't even post a picture! All the details care.com posts, are very important. If you don't understand one or can't figure it out, google it till you do or ask care.com!!! It is NOT all about the money. I have gotten so many jobs on here and started from scratch. And I am now having families message ME all the time! So, I would suggest you make some changes and keep trying instead of blaming care.com who is just doing their job of giving us tons of names everyday.

As far as the initial contact is concerned, I generally would set up and hold a phone interview first and then if that goes well and both sides agree to move forward is when you can set up your \"face to face\" interview, which generally will take place within a few days of the initial contact. You will find some families will prefer you coming to their home to do the interview, others might prefer a neutral location like a coffee shop, restaurant, etc. I myself have never had a bad experience using this site, but I would do my due diligence prior to a meeting just as a precaution. For example, google the address they provide and any names they give you, most of the time nothing alarming will present itself but it's always best to check anyways. NEVER give any of your personal information to a potential employer until after you have met them and they are considering hiring you and need to run background checks or verify you in general. I hope this helps, and good luck in your search, I have no doubt you'll find something very soon!!"

If asked directly I would repeat what my rate includes-- child related clean up, bottles, and a load or two of CHILD laundry. Family laundry, dishes from the weekend, other housework isn't something I do. Unless we discussed it and I charge an add on fee.

Care takes the money from you then wants you to upgrade before they either send your info to prospective clients or puts you at the bottom of the list. Now with the clients, they do the same, they do not send the care needed to any of the care givers unless they upgrade and pay a fee. They will put it out there for caregivers to see but will not send the messages from the caregivers to the clients or if they do, only a couple until they upgrade and pay the fee.

I do agree that life circumstances get in the way, but I do believe people would be able to manage these circumstances by being more mindful of what they are spending money on.

Care charges a premium of $20/mo or $50/6mo or a yearly fee which depends on you and you can stop it at anytime (downgrade). A premium doesn\u2019t guarantee a job because you need to actively be on the website, apply for jobs (at least 20 jobs in a day) and parents look at your education, certifications, age, experiences, location and much more. Some areas are highly competitive and you are competing with highly qualified candidates as well. These are the things you need to keep in mind. The premium will give you a free motor vehicle record check which can be a substitute for a background check (if you can\u2019t afford that), appear higher on the search list from parents, be able to message them back and forth and apply to jobs ahead of those that don\u2019t have the membership.\nUnfortunately, care won\u2019t reimburse you your $$$$. Hopefully you just downgrades your premium. Good luck and sorry for your poor experience with care. Reading is the key!"

If you don't feel brave enough to confront them just text that since they deceived you about pay you will not be returning. Tell them they have 5 business days to pay you before you report them to care.com . And either way, report them to care.com.

Instead of saying you have a clean driving record & clear background.  Parents like to hear that you can provide proof & give them copies of all your pertinent information.  You can get help through Care for a fee.  You need to sell yourself, get families to write a review for you.  Sometimes age can go against you but you just need no matter the age you can be the right person for that right family.  Good luck in the childcare industry.  Hope some of this helps."

But if it was a really consistent thing with someone, like every single week, then I'd first talk to them about changing the day that I get paid to something that works better for them. If that doesn't fix it or if they say they don't want to, then I'd probably just charge my hourly rate per day, so since you make $15 per hour, I'd tack on an extra $15 per day. But like I said, I've never imposed a late fee on anyone or ever even talked about it, so this is just my opinion and definitely not any kind of professional advice on the topic or anything."

If it was a puppy or hard-to-manage dog, or I had to walk the dog, I would charge extra. With one family, I fed the cat and dog, made sure there was clean water, and opened the backdoor for the dog. The kids were older so they could help with that, too. Actually, the younger one loved to help, and so it was a great activity/lesson for her! For my current family, they have two dogs who I let in and out, and occasionally fill the water. I very rarely feed them. If the younger one looks at me all cute and let\u2019s out these little cries, I\u2019ll give them a treat. But that\u2019s voluntary cause I\u2019m a pushover for a cute dog \ud83d\ude02 If they are out of town, I get an extra $30 a day to feed and let them out. Since I already live there, it\u2019s good easy money. \nI would charge extra for puppies, unruly dogs, extra duties required like dog walking, cleaning litter box, picking up poop, etc. For a situation where there\u2019s an unruly dog or a puppy, I\u2019d probably charge somewhere between $5-10 extra an hour? Depending how much work it is. If it was extra duties like walking, cleaning litter, etc., basically normal petsitting stuff, I would probably charge an extra flat fee each day I performed those duties. You can use something like Rover to decide what a good rate for your area would be. For me, maybe an extra $20 a day? If they were longer walks, I\u2019d be tempted to charge per walk, though. \nI hope that wasn\u2019t too hard to follow and helped anyone who needed it!

	"text": "Nanny tax procedures every family should know about\nUnsure of your responsibilities to your caregiver? Here's what the IRS wants you to do\n\n  \n 310 \nErik Johnson , Editor, Care.com HomePay\nnanny tax paper and calculator\nUpdated 2019-05-30\nIf you\u2019re hiring a nanny, you may have heard the term \u201cnanny taxes.\u201d But what exactly are they and are they applicable to you?\n \nYou should know: If you pay a nanny (or any other caregiver) $2,100 or more during the course of the calendar year, you must withhold taxes from their paychecks and pay your share of taxes as a household employer. Not only is it illegal if you don't, but it may also do your nanny a huge disservice. Your nanny is breaking the law, too when they\u2019re not reporting the wages they\u2019re earning from you. And not having proof of income can prevent them from qualifying for things like car loans and apartment rentals.\n \n\"I've had clients tell me they pay taxes simply because, in their profession, customers expect them to do things the right way,\u201d says Tom Breedlove, Sr. Director of Care.com HomePay. \u201cThey're not considered trustworthy if they do the opposite in their personal lives.\"\n \nWhat are the benefits of paying taxes for your nanny?\nYes, taxes add an extra cost to your care budget, but they\u2019re also important for your financial well-being. Here are a couple of the benefits of paying your nanny legally.\n \nFinancial security for your nanny \u2014 now and in the future. Having taxes withheld will ensure that your nanny can prove their work history, collect unemployment if you have to let them go and build credit with the Social Security Administration so they\u2019ll qualify for Medicare and Social Security payments upon retirement.\n \nPeace of mind for you. You may think that if you're not running for office, you'll never get caught not paying taxes. But it happens more often than you'd think. All it takes is for your former nanny to file for state unemployment benefits, which triggers the IRS to realize you've never paid household employment taxes. Or if the working relationship between you and your nanny sours and they file a wage dispute, your lack of tax payments could easily be brought to light.\n\nFind out if your industry is on the list of the Top 11 professions most at risk if not paying nanny taxes.\n \nHow much will I have to pay in nanny taxes?\nA good estimate is 10 percent of your nanny's gross wages, but this can vary by state. Social Security taxes are 6.2% and Medicare taxes are another 1.45%. The rest is made up of unemployment insurance taxes and any additional taxes your state may assess. Check the details in your state for more information.\n \nIf you'd like to run a specific budgeting scenario, check out our nanny tax calculator for a quick answer.\n \nAre there tax breaks to lower the cost of my nanny taxes?\nYes, there are two tax breaks most people can take to offset the tax liability you incur by hiring a nanny:\n \nDependent Care Account. Ask your employer if they offer a Dependent Care Account (a type of FSA) as part of your benefits package. This lets you set aside up to $5,000 of your annual income before taxes and then use that money to pay for child care expenses, such as your nanny\u2019s wages. Reducing your overall taxable income by $5,000 will reduce your tax burden. Your tax savings will depend on the tax bracket you're in, but most families save about $2,000 per year.\n \nChild Care Tax Credit. This lets you claim 20 percent of the first $3,000 you spend on child care if you have 1 child, or $6,000 if you have 2 or more children. This results in up to either $600 or $1,200 in savings. If you have one child, it\u2019s usually better to use a Dependent Care Account if you have access to it.\n\nIf you have 2 or more children, you can use both tax breaks! Your first $5,000 in child care expenses will go toward the FSA and an additional $1,000 can be put toward the child care tax credit. This saves you an additional $200.\n \nHow do I set up payroll for my nanny and start making tax payments?\nThe most efficient way to pay taxes on your household employees is to sign up with a payroll service like HomePay. For a quarterly fee, we'll direct deposit your nanny's paychecks to her bank account, withhold all appropriate taxes and file them electronically. If you\u2019re more of a DIY person, read our tips on how to pay nanny taxes yourself."

Did I serve with love? Did I respect and love my neighbor as myself? If I have not caused anyone harm deliberately? Then today was a good day. Tomorrow will only get better because I have many opened doors and opportunities that lies ahead for me.\nWhether it be on care.com platform or chatroom,  or Facebook or Twitter. All people really want is to be loved.\nYou ain't never seen love misuse, abuse, mistreat or bite it's own hand.\nThanks for letting me share.\nI did see that I have until 7/23/20 to pay if I choose to use this care.com platform.(14.99)\nThanks for your request."

In that case charge your regular fee every hour you are there. 4 PM to 10 a.m.  is 18 hours. For me that would be $360. But that's a chunk of change so you should give parents a heads up in advance.  May I ask why you would commit to a job without discussing yr fee? Sounds like a recipe for disaster to me. What if they show up Sunday morning and hand you $75 bucks because after all the kids were asleep most of the time.  Talk about it now so there are no surprises."

	"text": "Hi!\nI think that self-care is very important in this profession, because if I am not taking care of myself, then how am I going to take care of someone else\u2019s children whose parents are depending on me to do the best job to the best of my ability? For instance, if I show up to my job late, stressed out, exhausted, hungry, upset about something unresolved, overworked, unhappy or burnt-out, then it will for certain come out in my care for the children who I am put in charge of. I am being paid to work and do my best for them and make them all feel secure, and parents are trusting me. \n\nI am preaching straight to myself, because I had fallen into one of these traps and had to stop and deal with it head on, rearrange my entire schedule, and start over, or I was going to lose my job!! I wasn\u2019t making any time for \nself-care! My problem was not arriving on time to work here and there, which is unacceptable!!! Parents rely on pick-ups and meal time prep and babysitting schedules, and I seemed to have some ridiculous disaster or traffic jam or something that would make me late sometimes and it was becoming an issue. It is a hard thing to admit. But it can become a bad habit, if it is not dealt with! \n\nThis is what happened in about a week: One day, my refrigerator broke down 2 hours before I had to leave and had to put everything in coolers; My employer asked me to stop at the grocery store for her last minute; A tractor went 10 miles an hour the whole 15 miles to her house down a back road; Our dog of 11 years suddenly collapsed just before I left and  died that day; A train a minute from my house sat on the tracks and didn\u2019t move and had to go 15 minutes out of my way the long way; Construction is unbelievable and unpredictable in my town; I could go on and on how little disasters get in the way of my job! It is strangly odd! BUT, it just can\u2019t happen I kept telling myself!!! It is a requirement that I be on time daily for any job!!! I had to get over this problem FAST!\n\nI had one too many jobs and had to quit one. One was ending due to the school year, and that was the answer! Then I needed to rearrange my schedule, clear some things, and add a babysitter and give myself more free time to breathe and to get paper work and errands done. \n\nI have changed my whole schedule and lifestyle and jobs, setting better priorities, boundaries, and slow down. Now my schedule and self-care is much more calm and peaceful, easy-going and smooth! I am recommitted to being on time and it is a top priority!!\nI took weeks rearranging my schedule to clear up my days more, and my days are less cluttered and I made my life more organized and simplified. Now things are more calm, and I always plan to leave for work much earlier than needed and then I end up on time! \n\nWhen I recognized myself starting to develop a bad habit, I was so thankful for the chance to learn from it, change my ways, grow and move forward to become a better worker and create new and better habits.\n\nHere are some ways I practice self-care:\nI believe self-examination is part of self-care. What I mean by that is that we are able to be on top of knowing what changes we need to make to keep our priorities in tact and knowing our needs emotionally, personally, spiritually, physically, mentally, and in all areas of our life as individuals. We have to take care of ourselves and our own needs and yes, our own wants, so that we can care for others. If we go overboard, like I tend to do, always serving and giving to the point of exhaustion, then we will end up sick or burn-out or run down in the long run. It is a balance!\n\nI always spend lots of time with my husband, who is my best friend in life, and my 3 year-old little boy who is the joy and delight of our lives, as well as our grown children we adore. They light up my life and recharge me instantly! \n\nGetting to go out with a friend or relative or alone for \u201cfree\u201d time or \u201cme\u201d time or \u201cdate night\u201d to just chat and do something fun has to be part of my week now at this age and raising a child and working, because that prevents burn-out for me too and keeps me from giving ALL of myself away, which I can tend to do too much of on the job. \n\nI settle down early at night, after preparing for the next day, so I am not going crazy in the morning. I always make lists!! If I don\u2019t, I forget everything! I bring my favorite drinks to keep me rehydrated for work and a simple snack or lunch. An occasional massage or margarita or pedicure is always a big treat too! LOL\nLove to take walks at night too! \n\nSo, adding things to your busy day that make you just \u201cSMELL THE ROSES!!!\u201d can help you restart your engine, doesn\u2019t it, just like a cup of coffee or tea in the morning!! :)\n\nDeal breakers for me when looking for a job are the job must be enjoyable, I must connect with the family, and it has to be worth the pay and hours for me to make the drive there. Also, sometimes, the parents make soooo many requirements for the job at the interview and go on for 2 hours about their restrictions and needs that I just would rather say no and take a less complicated job than all the fuss! I am running into these jobs lately. The deal breaker is more simplicity. So many expectations for small or average pay is not worth it to me, or some even try to cram so much into 2 hours of work. That is too much pressure and then I never leave on time or get paid extra for staying late. So, those jobs are not for me.\n\nWith honesty and politeness are how I deal with difficult conversations. I had to quit a job because the parent was making it so complex and complicated for so little pay and adding more and more work for such little time and keeping me there over time with no extra pay. I was traveling from 25 minutes away too. So I had to quit! She wanted to know exactly why. So I was completely honest and she did not like it. But honesty, I believe, put as kindly and nicely as possible, is the best way. If we lie and sugar-coat our answers, we are making it harder for the next caregiver the parent tries to hire. And honesty and being up front is always the best policy. I continued the conversation with politeness and many compliments and with gratitude, but was honest why I had to quit. \n\nMy advice to new caregivers would be to make time for yourself once a day and make time for yourself to get out with someone else once a week! You need ME TIME! Also, love yourself inside out. Stop dwelling on the past. It\u2019s ok to forget the past and move on! Enjoy the new you and look forward to the future!  And, LOVE those children! Have patience with little ones always!  Enjoy their laughter, innocence, silliness and even their issues: children are only little once! They teach us so much in just one sitting, if we just would slow down, put the electronics down, breathe and listen more! ALL children are simply AMAZING!! Press on, my fellow caregivers, the best is yet to come! It only gets better with each job! This profession is the very best and most rewarding! And care.com is #1! You are the best babysitter/nanny ever when you do your very best and know your job well!"

	"text": "Hi Jenna! I had a mixture of all sorts of families that either are very knowledgeable about having a nanny or have no clue at all. The families that are knowledgeable usually have their ducks in a row. They mention contracts, vacation time, benefits, bereavement time, taxes, and lots of more things. I will say that many of these families have contacted agencies in the past and have either really loved them or hated them. One family mentioned they went with care.com because they overheard how an employee of the agency was talking to their nanny on the phone and they didn\u2019t appreciate it because they had grown to love her as a member of their family. Needless to say when their nanny left due to getting married they went to care.com to find their next nanny. Another family went with care.com because they didn\u2019t want to pay the consulting fee for finding a new nanny. \n\nThen I have families where I have to bring up having a contract, asking about any medical diagnosis I should be aware of, who\u2019s their emergency contact references, who\u2019s their preferred doctor, and lots more. My favorite response from one of the families I interviewed with was \u201coh none of the other candidates we interviewed asked us to provide any of this information, are you sure this information is needed?\u201d Now mind you based on the holistic books that I clearly can see out on the table in front of me, I wanted to say \ud83d\ude12No Kelly if Jim has a symptoms of the flu while you\u2019re on a business trip do you want me to look for techniques to treat his symptoms or take him to the pediatrician. If I haven\u2019t asked these questions and had to fly by the seams of my pants my answer would be to the pediatrician! Needless to say, they offered me the job but I declined it. \n\nThen we have the families that have used google way too much. They want to know my blood type, credit score, talk to personal and professional references, want to take a picture of my license plate, and lots more. Nooooooo ma\u2019am!!! The funny thing is they wanted all of this information when they only planned to book two or three times a month for a date night. Ummmmm no I\u2019ll pass. \n\nI think like any \u201cjob engine\u201d care.com has a mixture of well informed and truly clueless employers. I get a lot of clients through care.com but tons of clients through word of mouth. I prefer word of mouth because then atleast I know my client will tell them what to expect when speaking with me. I try to remain open to adding more families either through the site or by other means. If it\u2019s not for me then I just decline it. \n\nI will also like to add that ALOT of people don\u2019t seem to understand about taxes. That always use to be something I was asked about but now not so much because I take care of my own taxes as a LLC."

One of my first families wanted to \u201chold back\u201d a weeks pay?!! I was very clear in the interview about pay. Parents seem to think once you start with a family you will let your guard down. At end of week-I worked 4 days while they hired a cleaning lady and bought supplies for a party, then they said I\u2019d get paid the following Friday. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I left and went on care.com and requested my pay! As expected, I did not return to this family (though they left a nice review) and they paid through care.com my full amount the next day. Maybe they found someone to else \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. You were right. You suspected as much. Time to leave. You can respond to their review, if they leave a bad one. After that first family, I realized that a Nanny is a financial commitment. I work part time for many families and I never expect one family to come up with a huge amount every week. Also, my fee is $20-$25 per hour and that is twice what these families want to pay."

Many of us cannot afford a premium membership as we are the ones looking for work. You say one-time need, but a lot of caregivers and families are looking for long-term partnerships. I'm not going to pay for a membership just to apply to families looking for long-term care who are too cheap to pay. I question their seriousness of finding and retaining a caregiver and whether they will be able to pay what a private caregiver deserves. The Care fee is pennies compared to what a family pays for an agency's service. It didn't even used to be like this. When I first joined Care almost 9 years ago, only the families had to pay, which was a much safer way to do it. \nAnd yes, you are right, there is definitely a lack of effort on some applicants. Many of them are young and naive and don't know any better. \nI hope you are able to find a good caregiver for your children, Kathi, and thank you for your perspectives you add (:"

Here are some results:\nAt 38K you will be making about $16 per hour if vacation is paid. If it is not you will be making  $17 per hour.   However, that is  ONLY for the 8-5, if you work extra hours such as overnights you will make less per hour.  \nI'm assuming that by \"taxes omitted\" means they want to pay you under the table.  Aside from the fact that that is not legal it also leaves you in bad spot.  If you file, expect to pay at least 20% of that in taxes.  If you don't, you also are breaking the law and get none of the benefits of being a taxpayer (especially social security).\nMy free advice (and remember you get what you pay for!) is that this job is set up to the total advantage of the family and you would be better to look elsewhere.  \nGood luck, let us know what you decide."

I have found 90%+ of my client families from here so annoyingly yes, If I was required to pay the screening fee, I would. I didn't, which I thought was because I pay for a BGC every 6 months but others who do the same did get the message that they'd need to be charged so I'm not sure what Care's criteria is for who they are requiring to pay the fee."

	"text": "Okay, so I am going to give you some real-life advice right now. First of all, get out of that situation. I understand that it's family and it's your mother but she should be wanting what's best for you and working you to the bone for nothing isn't fair to you as you start your life. I have no idea what your relationship with her is like, but I am going to give you a few options.\n\nOption 1: If your mom is not the type to kick you out for \"quitting\" the babysitting job then go about things this way. I am assuming you have no credit or very little. I know credit cards get a bad wrap but you need to start building credit. Apply for a credit card with no annual fee and just put small things on it like a fast-food meal etc. and pay it off as soon as the bill comes through. This will help a huge amount when you start looking for a car if you are going to go through a dealership. If you have ANY money saved up try to save up about $3,000 to $5,000 for a clunker you can buy outright. On Facebook, they have the market, look on there or in ads for people selling their cars near you. If the thing can take you from point A to point B use it until that thing dies. THEN I suggest getting a job that will give you great money. I bartended at a nearby airport and made $80,000 in one year alone. You can legally bartend at the age of 18. If you have no idea how to do that look into it, great fast money and can help get you out of that situation easily. You could even help mom out with bills if you stay at home and you'll only have insurance to pay on your car. You can also be a server but you have to pick good locations to get a good income going.\n\nOption 2: Find a live-in nanny position. This will get you out of your situation while paying you the right amount allowing you to save your money and eventually get a car. Again, apply for that credit card to build up your credit, this way you can get a more reliable car. Regardless, you will need a cosigner for a car because of your age, income, and credit score, which is another reason I suggest buying from a person who's getting rid of their car. Like I said if it runs take it. Don't worry about anything that can be wrong with it because if you get a car for a couple of grand then it's worth it if it's able to get to and from where you have to be until you get on your feet. \n\nLike I said I have no idea how your relationship with your mom is but if you can live there while getting on your feet do it. If not then let her know you will be looking for a new job and as soon as you get it you will be moving out (that's if you get a live-in). If not and she still wants you out, write up a contract that you will move out once you can afford a car and have.. $5,000 in the bank. Legally your mother cannot kick you out without notice, after the age of 16 you have rights similar to a tenant so don't forget that.\n\nIf you have any other questions at all, ask away. I have helped so many of my friends leave situations like yours and they're doing well now. You just need the guidance and a little bit of information on how to do it. Be smart with your money! Good luck hun!"

Buy the premium it\u2019s $20/mo but since you are a beginner, I suggest you get the 6 months premium for $50 to really pop up on parents search list. Either way, you will still get the MOTOR VEHICLE RECORD CHECK for FREE (with the 6mo plan, you can update it at anytime as long as you are a premium member).  Background check is Almost the same price as the 6mo premium and the website only requires you to have at least one background check. If you can\u2019t afford all 3 (MVR, background & premium), then your best perk is the 6mo premium. Add a debit card on file and apply to at least 30 jobs in a day. Respond quickly to message. All of these will boost you more to have th e Carepro status. \nYou can look up some previous posts on how to enhance your biography it\u2019s usually the first key at declining applicants. It\u2019s based on your location, education, experiences, certifications and what you are willing to do on the job which can be factored into your hourly rate. Don\u2019t work for a salary and if you will be working for one family at a time as a nanny make sure they enroll you in Homepay on care to get you a W4 to fill out and then a W2 at the end of January so that you can do your taxes. Do not fill out the 1099 form and make sure you are earning at least the minimum hourly rate of your state! Be bold and get a contract too about your rate, being paid on time, on the book (no cash), late fee for cancellations, paid vacation or sick days.....\nDon\u2019t be discouraged to turn down parents that want to low ball you and stand up when they are taking advantage of you.\nLook up some previous you have all of your answers.

	"text": "Hello!\nSo I decided a long time ago what my hourly rate range is for full time nanny positions depending on what they are asking for as far as duties and expectations. I have done the same for babysitting. Which is a different level than being a full time nanny. I have an hourly babysitting rate that starts when I arrive. I also change a flat over night fee for the times when I will be sleeping over. The flat rate starts when the children will be asleep and not at \"bedtime\". It ends  when they normally would wake up. Then hourly again until parents said they would be home. Anything beyond what we've agreed to for return time is higher per hour because they're late and it's not a genuine emergency. I do hourly if I am not expected to sleep over, or if must be awake the entire time. Yes, I've had parents request that. \nFor example, my normal hourly rate is 15 an hour for babysitting four kids and under. The amount of children not the ages. For more than 4 but less than sleepover numbers I charge 18. For three kids and under its 75 for the flate rate. For four kids to up to 6 its 100. For over six kids it would be 150. Sleepovers really do happen sometimes. \nYou should decide what you wish to fairly charge. Don't leave it open for the parents to decide. Be honest with what you charge and be sure to tell them what you do to earn that money. Such as fun activities planned for their children specifically or a cute breakfast idea the kids can help with!\nThat is just what I do. Feel free to do what works for you!"

If you just want to do childcare with no housekeeping (you can clean after the kids for the mess they will make during your presence, the plates you will use for their food or their cooking, maybe children laundry), then charge between $20-$25/hr for 1 kid and $24-$30/hr for 2 kids.\nIf you will be driving them to activities with your own car, get the irs rate of 57.5 cents per mileage to cover gas,,wears and tears on your car (don\u2019t take any flat fee for it)."

Also, I have to do what they say when they say it or they start screaming and crying and their parents work from home and I fee so embarrassed and stressed. I want to quit but I don\u2019t know how to tell them, they are nice people but I just can\u2019t handle the kids. Also, this is my third job in the day. Please how can I quit without them getting mad at me, I have their keys and car seat. I\u2019ve been with them for a week. I know it sounds unprofessional but it\u2019s gotten to a point where I feel attacked and I fee like I can\u2019t discipline them because they just go running to their parents and tell on me that I\u2019m mean.

Make sure you ask them for reviews that's the reason I get plenty of clients.

Oh and a really big perk, they set your rate. No more $10/hour offerings for 3 kids with pickup and drop off and light housekeeping. The one job was a drop off plus an hour of babysitting and I made $30. The other one was a pickup and I made $25. I am really hoping it catches on!"

	"text": "When taking kids out and spending money on them, should parents pay for caregivers as well? For example, this week I took the toddler I nanny to chick-fil-a to run out some energy in their play area on a rainy day and parents gave me $20 to get her lunch, I only spent $6 of it because I got her lunch and just got myself a drink. Today they had me take her to a children\u2019s play museum and the mom told the toddler I\u2019d get her a cake pop afterwards, I felt a little silly going through the drive thru of Starbucks ordering just a cake pop lol. Should parents pay for lunch/coffee of caregiver if the caregiver is taking the child(ren) out for food? When I nannied for families with more children I would usually just take them out for pizza so we\u2019d get a large pizza and pitcher of lemonade that I\u2019d share with them, but with just a toddler my food would be more expensive than kids meals so I feel bad making them pay for it, but I\u2019m also on a tight budget so I wouldn\u2019t choose to go out for lunch if the parents didn\u2019t tell me to. Obviously if parents have me take their kids somewhere that requires an adult admission fee (like a movie or a museum that charged adult and child admission) I\u2019d make them pay for my ticket, but I\u2019m on the fence with food. Thoughts?"

	"text": "For me, I find that I need to make sure the family is serious about me before ever meeting up with them.\n\nI find that some families can give you a \u2018false hope\u2019 to keep you on a sting so that you don\u2019t apply elsewhere...just so they have you as a backup.\n\nI experienced this with 3 families back-to-back \u2014 families hiring me \u2018they say\u2019 then not following through. In the meantime, I would have several other families trying to interview me, but I had to decline because I was already on the hook with the family that said they wanted to hire me.\n\nAnyway, this only happened 3 times back to back...and then I learned my lesson.  I use a lot of intuition and pay close attention to the person I am chatting with. If I find any ambiguity or changing of meet-up times, etc...then I find a way out of the interview so I don\u2019t waste time.\n\nI have found the best jobs to be the ones where they found me first. I don\u2019t ever apply anymore. I just make my profile as good & flexible as possibly so that they will seek me out. I asked for reviews, I paid for the criminal background check, I pay the monthly fee so that I am advertised first, I get certified for first aid, CPR & swimming training, child development classes, I mark \u2018yes\u2019 on almost every service offered even though I my main focus is to take care of the kids...and not clean the house.\n\nMy bio mentions how safety conscious that I am. I say something like \u201cI am happy to adhere to parental guidelines, but I am very safety conscious, so there will be times that I use my own judgment to make sure the child is safe.\u201d  This is actually true about me.\n\nIt took time to develop a good reputation so that families would seek me out. I had to be strategic.\n\nHere\u2019s another tip, if a family says that they will pay between $12-18 per hour, what they really mean is that...they won\u2019t pay more than $12 per hour - period! So, I don\u2019t even apply to jobs that mention a pay rate that I cannot do. I don\u2019t like wasting time.\n\nAlso, I have come to learn that families like lots of references. When you do get a reference, make sure it is a 5 star. The first 3 references set the \u2018tone\u2019 for your desirability.\n\nAnyway, again...just \u2018change your game\u2019 and figure out what works best for you. Also, you need to remember...for every job posted, there are about 40-50 applicants. So...be the first to apply. Be excited that they interviewed you - it\u2019s a good sign!"

And I pay for the background checks as well.. also a tax write off... so if that gets you pushed to the head of the table for work (it does for me) and you will appear more hireable also because of your background checks.. \n\nAlso list at least 3 solid references on your profile. I have I think nearly a dozen references or more on my own profile... \n\nOpen yourself up to more than just being a nanny.. offer tutoring, pet care, errands, cleaning, laundry, nutritionists background or household management, party planner etc. if you\u2019ve got experience doing stuff all sorts of stuff then list it... on your profile... \n\nYou\u2019ll be snatched up luckily split if you follow the advice given in this website... \n\nAlso know what the local average nanny wage is for your area.. I set mine at $5 + hire than everyone else\u2019s average because of my experience and knowledge in childcare and household management... I\u2019m well worth my starting price point. And I do not accept less than my value. Also I recommend not working under the table.. which many nanny\u2019s apparently do... if you work for a family do it legitimately... \n\nJust my FYI from my 30 years of experience working with families... \n\nAir hugs and blessings on your future endeavors.. \n\nNanny Sherri"

I would simply go over what was initially discussed and that the extras would be an extra fee. If the children were in daycare, they would charge per child.

Khakis and a nice long-sleeve cotton shirt that is buttoned up to  the neck is always good. Don't look sexy in any way.\n\nI'm very concerned that you are meeting at a coffee shop. Do not release any of your private identity information until you have this person's full name and their address. And also if you see them drive up in a car take a picture of their license plate with your cell phone but very discreetly.\n\nThis is a recipe for someone stealing your personal identity. I understand from their point of view if they don't want some stranger coming to their home, but my experience has always been we talk over the phone they get a feel for me and then that have me interview them at their home and I meet their children and the children meet me and we see if we are a good fit. So this sounds very odd to me that you would meet someone at a coffee shop.\n\nThere many scam stories here in Los Angeles that people do exactly this and they still your personal identity information. By law in the state of California, you do not release any references or ID information until you have the full name address other person that would be your potential employer. You do not give any references out until you have identity information of your potential employer. And you can always politely say that you are fear of personal identity theft and I trust you are too so please let us do an even exchange of information. But also insist not to go any further in the interview until you meet the children. You cannot make any commitment until you see how long you would have to travel to get to their home and meet the children. Never ever email your personal information unless you have their full name and address and you have everything checked out in person. Good luck!"

One parent,  a single parent, called and asked for New Years Eve, for instance. I did not want to lose this client by charging a higher fee for the booking. I already discussed with my husband that if someone needed help, I\u2019d probably book from my normal families. This would have been the first  time I worked for her. I charged her my normal rate, which for her included a local discount. . She paid me my higher rate, and tipped me \ud83d\ude0e , and paid for my Uber home! I\u2019ve worked for them again, and have a booking in February with them. So, that booking had great value \ud83d\ude09 I feel it\u2019s up to me if I want to work. Sure, if you offer me more and I think about the value I may say YES quicker if I\u2019m not busy. I turned down a local lady the other day, because I was just too tired. Lots of things to consider.

	"text": "I agree, that's a ton of work to be getting  payed that far under the legal minimum wage (assuming you are from California as well..) Regardless, there is no easy way to ask to be payed more, but I believe just being honest yet extremely polite about the situation would be best. Perhaps invite her to sit down and get coffee (assuming she can get the kids taken care of a few hours without you) and just explain the situation. More explicitly I would begin by telling her that working with her kids/ her family has been more than a pleasure and has been such a great opportunity in your life but there are some difficulties that come along with it. I would mention that given the long hours you work and that the increasing demands of living expenses make it difficult to live comfortable and that in order for you to continue to support and take care of yourself financially, you're seeking to increase your pay a bit. I find it extremely important to express to her how much you've thought about it and how much you genuinely hate to ask in fear of sounding rude or damaging your relationship with her but, remind her that it's necessary for your independent-well-being as well. However, I would strongly advise against bringing up the other child's behavior and the additional burden she may bring because that is very likely to strike the wrong nerve with almost any parent. As long as you make it clear it's nothing personal and nothing between you and the children and strictly a necessity of business, she should be more compliant and more understanding. Best of luck, love!"

I feel like a few bottles or sippy cups aren\u2019t a huge deal to clean. If you have a huge issue with this maybe have a conversation with the mom talking about the dishes in the sink. I\u2019ve been a nanny for 14 years and it\u2019s my duty to make the family at ease when they come home from work I can\u2019t count the amount of times there\u2019s been countless dishes in the sink non stop. I don\u2019t resent that ..parents are busy and sometimes they just don\u2019t have time to do that. My mind set is to make the families life easier when they come home so they don\u2019t have to worry about cleaning stuff non stop as I\u2019m sure they want to just spend time with their kiddo. Being helpful goes a long way in the kind of job we have. I go above and beyond for the families which is why raises, bonuses , paid time off , sick days are thrown my way . Sometimes you have things in your job you don\u2019t wanna do but in the end it\u2019s worth it. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to come off rude I just don\u2019t think a few bottles is something to \u201cfeel bad\u201d about or to charge an extra fee. Talking to the mom would be ideal or if you want research Nanny duties and you\u2019ll see if it pertains to the child then that\u2019s what you should be taking care of. Good luck ."

I think Care has to do this to compete and so they don\u2019t get sued. There are new sites popping up that conduct the background check on all sitters and nannies for free. I can\u2019t see how Care can compete with that if they don\u2019t do the same.

If that doesn't happen, that time slot is opened up to any other family. \n\nI also uphold the \"cancel too often, find another girl\" policy: I may not tell parents that's why I'm suddenly always unavailable, but I expect parents to be as responsible and reliable as I am.

I\u2019m sure he\u2019s uncomfortable with you there too, but he hast to work and he wants to have a snack or a cup of coffee just like he would at work. \n\nThings are rapidly changing in the world right now, and I really don\u2019t think they\u2019re ever going to go back to exactly the same way they were. There probably will actually be a lot less jobs for nannies people discover more and more they can survive at home without us, especially if instead of trying to help them we are quitting or threatening to, whining, getting on their nerves, being more trouble to them than their children, etc. We really need to help one another in these times and try to make things as easy on all of us as possible. It is always difficult to be thrown into a new position especially when it means virtually living with somebody that we don\u2019t really know. In the olden days when people got married before they moved in with one another, there was a lot of rude awakenings when you got up the first morning not really knowing one another\u2019s morning habits. People suddenly working from home with her nanny is pretty much the same kind of situation. I think at this point we need to be happy For whatever jobs we have and make the best of things until things settle out to whatever the new normal will be."

	"text": "Hello, I think there are 3 possible solutions to this issue: you should maybe ask for $50 considering you also forgot about pay day, let her off the hook, or tell her you need your $100 late fee. It is both your responsibilities to remember when payday is. Parents are busy and get overwhelmed with other things in their lives, that\u2019s why they hire and pay us to help them out. It is our time and our earned money and we must speak up. I have had to speak up regarding a check that had the wrong balance on it. I was missing $150 and had I not spoken up there would\u2019ve been more confusion later on. Just imagine it\u2019s payday and you don\u2019t say anything, when will you ever get paid if neither of you remember or say anything? I suggest the family gets a calendar for the refrigerator and they post everyone\u2019s schedule on it, including your paydays, this may help cut down on having to mentally remember payday. It will help everyone physically see it when they enter the kitchen or fridge. Good luck."

She doesn't speak, scream, dance, que that she's peed and uncomfortable or anything. Her mom was home when I was there. She sat in her bedroom on the phone smoking while I swept the floor from crumbs, dirt, ANTS... She sat there and smoked for two hours, on the phone with a friend. I don't mean to eavesdrop but they don't have a door and she's a tad loud. She was just having a good time. (She hired me to babysit while she worked on her computer and had business calls, and she told me I was to watch the kids when she LEAVES the house.) She never told me when her baby was last changed or when any children were last fed, didn't tell me when I should start cooking. The kids had to tell me when they were hungry- the gal wouldn't speak to me until she got off the phone to actually answer me when I asked- and I felt horrible. She left with a quick bye (2:15 ish). In the time she was gone, the three kids ate the food I was told to make - all done at once, and cooked to the right temp, etc. - and then the two older ones had an ice cream sandwich, washed themselves up. The little one just played with her doll around the table until everyone else was done eating, then she and I watched TV for a little bit. I decided to clean her room and make her bed since my task last time was to clean her whole bedroom. I also cleaned the children's rooms. Swept the other floors. Her baby never moved. I always checked on her. She was just laying underneath a blanket. Half asleep but never napping. Watching baby bum. I have a daughter of my own, and I never leave her unchecked. But there was absolutely no sign. The mom came home at 6. Thirty minutes late, I was supposed to be home by 5:30. My family waited to cook dinner and it was getting dark. All the gal wanted to do was talk and smoke some more. I was off by then and I was no longer responsible. She never once checked on her kids. She went straight to the freezer for a coffee cup and back to her room. Where I was still cleaning. Two days later we're debating and she's not having her way and she suddenly tells me her baby has a nasty rash because I neglected her baby girl and i told her absolutely everything I did and then apologized, man it's crazy. I also got let go, but I have another client and they're fantastic- 4 kids!!"

For example, I have a checkings, savings, as well as an account specifically for shopping or spending more than $5-10 on lunch. I only keep a small amount in my checkings, enough to pay for my spotify and amazon prime accounts. I also leave around $50 for the week to grab food or a coffee when I want it. \n\nMy savings I make myself put at least $40/week in, sometimes more if I make more that week than normal.

I have not yet contacted care voicing my concerns but I will be. \n\n\nHi Gabby,\n\nIt\u2019s our mission to provide the best place to help caregivers like you find great jobs. Everyone now realizes what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 caregiving is critical to families and the services you provide are an essential part of our economy.\n\nRecently, we decided to increase our level of screening for caregivers to include a background check, called a CareCheck. This safety screening is an important step in our commitment to creating a safer Care.com community. With CareCheck, families will have a safer foundation to evaluate caregivers, and caregivers will be able to find jobs more quickly to provide essential care.\n\nAs a result, in order to participate on our platform, all caregivers will be charged a $14.99 fee, which will automatically renew annually. By getting a CareCheck, you'll not only show families you're serious about safety, but you'll continue to have access to all of the same great benefits you enjoy now as a Care.com member.\n\nWe hope you\u2019ll get a CareCheck and continue using Care.com to find high-quality, well-paying jobs. On behalf of everyone at Care.com, thank you for being an important part of our caregiving community.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nTim Allen\nCEO, Care.com"

Have a private room where you can sleep late, read, watch TV etc?  Will you be able to come and go as you want when you aren't \"on duty\"? Are all your meals and transportation costs covered?  Will you get paid by the hour for every hour above and beyond your usual time?  If you are truly completely free during your off time and it is somewhere you want to go then I don't see the need to be paid around the clock. You aren't working around the clock.  But, if you are actually \"on duty\" 24/7 and bound to them then yes. Set a  daily fee.  I charge $18 an hour from 7 am to 10 pm (or whatever time adults are home and \"in charge\" and $5 an hour from 10 pm to 7 a.m.    $315 from 7 am to 7 am. But if it were over a week I would expect at least 3 hours per day time to myself AND one 12 hour day when I am NOT on duty but still getting paid.  That is still a deal for them. Over a week... $20 and hour and one 24 hour day paid per 7 day period.  Remember that tax laws/overtime rules are different for \"live in\" positions which this might be.  Having said all this, if you knew the job required out of state travel this should have been discussed before you committed.  If you didn't know it then you are in the driver's seat.  Just be sure you are ready to be fired or walk away if you can't come to agreeable terms."

If it\u2019s a regular, part or full time position, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to suggest an in person interview at a coffee shop, park, etc. That way, you can build up trust with the family before beginning your position. Then, you could do a trial run at their house, for them to see how you interact with the kids, get a better feel for your personality, etc. If you\u2019re still feeling uncomfortable, have a friend or family member go with you. I sometimes have people go with me before starting a new job, just to make sure everything\u2019s okay and as it should be. Also, tell your friends/family members where you\u2019re going, and what time you\u2019ll be back, etc. Keep in touch with them, too. That way they\u2019ll know where to find you if something goes wrong. If you ever feel that\u2019s something is off and you\u2019re uncomfortable, leave! Trust your gut.

In other words, if someone is going to need you the evening of Feb. 8 & 22, they need to ask you if you\u2019re available those days and, if you are, give you a firm commitment date for those dates. Many sitters do cancellation policies that without 48 hours or more notice, they\u2019ll pay a cancellation fee of some sort. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t just quit this current job if they\u2019re otherwise nice and paying decently. Instead you can start looking for more jobs, including Saturdays, and the next time they call you fo4 a Saturday job tell them, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m booked up,\u201d or \u201cSorry, I\u2019m busy that day.\u201d Then go out and have a fun Saturday yourself!"

Secondly, that's awful pay you've been receiving.  I charge $15/hr per client, $1-3 dollars extra an hour per extra client.  If you're caring for someone who's that fragile, cause it's such a fragile case, you should be getting no less than $15/hr starting with just him.  And since he's been added to your workload which I personally know is A LOT, the parents should be paying you extra fee for the fragile kid when you're needed to care for him.  I have years experience caring for children and adults with special needs, it's NOT AN EASY JOB.  Not at all and parents often don't care how exhausted you are, how much they've been lowballing you, and/or that you do so much for their family.  What you need to do.  Look for work elsewhere now to replace this job and don't tell them.  If you mention this to them, they may just fire you on the spot.  I recently left a job where I was caring for a family's adult son with special needs and I'm so glad to be out of that job to say the least.  The mom was abusive and very controlling, I was recieving crap pay, and doing so much for their son(which they really didn't appreciate at all).  Don't listen to what pple say to your face, listen to how they treat you.  Don't continue to stay with a family who doesn't value your time, expects too much from you, and doesn't at least pay you well.  I stayed with the family I left for 2 years...way too long let me tell you.  The longer I stayed, the worse it got.  My experience, this is how it is in every bad care situation.  I allowed it to go on for too long, but it was my choice which I realized in the end.  If you're on here posting this for advice that you're actually going to take and listen to us, then good for you.  If you're only intention in posting this is to get a bunch of pple huddled in your corner to feel sorry for you, I think that's pathetic.  I realize I don't know your intentions, and I seriously hope you're posting this for actual advice you're gonna seriously consider taking.  You may think I'm being harsh, but I know what it's like to work for pple who clearly don't appreciate you at all.  I know what it's like to get awful pay for endless hours on end(your precious time and energy).  I hope you choose to leave this job ASAP cause this is an awful position to be in.  I hope all the best for you."

Sometimes it can take a couple times especially if you're going around their schedule and time limit for the day.  I've had numerous clients get upset about that because they don't like paying thw extra to deep clean. Its a job and a hard job. Especially if you bring your own supplies and equipment that adds in as well. It's very frustrating especially if this is your only job. I've had clients short me on pay or have me do more than agreed upon with no extra pay too. Or do a commitment to clean for so long and then cancel that agreement costing me other clients."

Tell her you will need to enforce the late fee the next time you are paid late. You honestly deserve those late fees for every week that she paid you late, too, but I don\u2019t know if you want to go down that road. It\u2019s up to you. Another thing you could do is not leave the house on your payday every week until you see payment in your account/app. Show her your hours when she gets home and wait for her to calculate and send the money. \nGood luck and I hope your nanny mom gets her act together soon! \ud83d\ude0a"

Money is not returned to parents when the child(ren) do not attend.\nYes, you are being taken advantage of - do the math and add additional for the second child.\nSo sorry to read of this happening!  \nI've been there!"

I also charged pretty much the same price for a dog. like 15 for a 1/2 an hour walk, 20 for 45 mins. and 25 for an hour. Now it is more for my newer clients. You can do the same thing with your cat sits. If it is a new client and depending on how long you have been on this site and how many reviews you got. For example when I got 10 good reviews in the beginning, my prices went up, the 2nd time I got 10 more another hike in prices and the third time another one but the same client always kept the same. There are so many different ways of working with people and changing your prices. I do my research online to see what they charge for staying in someone's home or boarding. I understand people board cats for 30-35 dollars a day. I usually stay in people's homes and I charge a fee that is usually reasonable less than what it costs to stay in someone else's home. I have a client from another site, I charge 60 others charge between 75 and 85 or even more. It is very easy to take care of a cat. Not much work at all."

How many years of experiences? If you can respond, then I will be able to give you an estimation of your rate.\nKeep in mind that you are a caregiver which is different than a housekeeper & pet caregiver. These 3 things are separate. Don\u2019t agree on light housekeeping either, stick to only tending the kid(s) and clean up any dishes or mess you will be doing together. If you will be driving kids around, give them the IRS of 57.5 cents per mileage to cover gas, wears and years (don\u2019t do a flat rate).\nAdditionally, you have been working as a full time Nanny, they have to pay you ON THE BOOK but enrolling you on Homepay which is on care. If they or you log in to your account and scroll all the way down you will see it there under the section Discover. They have to use Homepay to enroll you in for a W4 to fill out before starting working for them. It will take care of your deductions and you will get a W2 to fill out at the end of each January to take it to a taxpayer and fill out your taxes. If you haven\u2019t done it so, you should immediately QUIT ASAP from this position. Paying you below the minimum wage is illegal and never agreed on a biweekly payment. It has to be the sum of your hourly rate and paid at the end of each Friday weekly before heading home. Add a late fee policy or cancellation.\nAlso, you are working 55 which is overtime. Each time you are working passed 40hours, you have to be paid at least your hourly rate and half.\nFurthermore, with more experiences, dealing with a special needed kid means your rate should go hire. \nFinally, talk or message this to the family as a group message that you are not coming back anymore. Collect your money. If they don\u2019t give you, you can report them on care. \n\u201cHello, hope your day is going well. Upon reassessing my position for this New Year 2020, I have noticed that I am only being laid $4.5/hr which is below the minimum wage of our state (ILLEGAL) and being a caregiver for a special needed kid that requires a lot of care, a housekeeper.... doesn\u2019t work anymore for me.\nI am willing to work for $xx/hr for no longer than 35-40hr per week with a weekly pay at the end of each Friday and a lateness fee of $20 for each day. I want to just for tending the kid(s), being enrolled in Homepay from Care to get me a W4 to fill out in order to receive a W2 to fill out my taxes at the end of each year, with no cash payment from no on (this is the legal way from irs). Otherwise, I can no longer work for your family. \nFeel free to let me know if you want to proceed forward. I won\u2019t be back tomorrow unless we have settled this. If not, good luck with your new search and thank you for your time because slavery was over many 199 years ago.\n\nKnow your worth and be carful next time! Good luck! Hopefully I was able to clear up things for you"

The seniors we care for have  medical issues requiring us to be trained in. Dementia, diabetes, stroke, Alzheimer's,  CHF, COPD, loss of mobility.  I find it odd when  a person is being used/disrespected and they state they like the person using them.  I fully understand the cost of care.  Here is the deal, no matter where you live, the person who hires you to provide care for another is your employer.  They must comply to that states  minimum wage law.   You are to be paid  even when you might be asleep. that's the law. There is a age law for caregivers,  included in that law, it explains clearly the wage to be paid to the caregiver.  A private room is to be provided for all over night/24hr care, that has nothing to do with the wage.  Your are to be paid for every hour you are in the home.  Lets say $12.50 hr X 24Hrs=$300 for each 24 shift.   I am a caregiver for over 17yrs, I specialize for live in care.  I have been known to discount my fee,  I am paid no less than $250 for each 24hr.  After taxes I end up clearing about $200 for each 24hr shift.   I do not do live in. On my days off I go home, I do not work more than four 24hr shifts.   You and others are being taken advantage of.  The family you like so much know it.  I realize they have limited funds.  However they do not decide the rules of the game, the labor board does.   Families are ending up in labor court.  You are owed so much in back wages.  You need to decide if you are a professional caregiver or are you desperate."

I said okay and that my hourly fee for a trial was $30 and if they decided to hire me my regular fee it would be $35/hr. Anyways I been on trial for about a month and they offered me the full time position but I don\u2019t think they remember that I had said my fee would change once I was working full time. Should I have the conversation to remind them or should I not even bring it up? We still have to figure out what will go on contract. They are super nice and I love the baby already but I just hate having those kind of conversations. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

	"text": "I need advice! I have a contract with my nanny family, and I feel they are violating it multiple ways. First, it includes guaranteed hours and paid holidays (Thangsgiving). I just got my paycheck from the last two weeks, and I got paid for Thanksgiving day, but not Wednesday (they said they didn\u2019t need me that day). Should I still be paid because of guaranteed hours? Second, I am supposed to get a late payment fee. The mom has paid me late multiple times, and the first time (I forgot to send her my mileage at the end of the pay period) I didn\u2019t ask for or get the late fee. This time I sent her my mileage AND reminded her but I still didn\u2019t get it. How can I ask for that? Third, I am supposed to do \u201clight housekeeping\u201d including kid\u2019s dishes. However over the weekends the parents make meals and don\u2019t do theirs or the kid\u2019s dishes. The kids are 9 and 11 and don\u2019t even scrape their plates before they pile them on the counter, if they even take them to the kitchen. They just leave the house generally trashed for me to deal with. I think the biggest problem is lack of communication. The parents are divorced and use me or the kids to communicate, and often I find important stuff out from the kids rather than the parents (schedule changes etc.). I love the family and I made sure to get a contract but now I don\u2019t know how to enforce the contract!"

	"text": "Hi there,\n\nI agree that some agencies can be a headache to deal with but I also know that there many good ones out there e.g. Nannies by Noa. The CEO Jo Barrow is phenomenal at what she does. So, I happily recommend them! Next, I want to point out that the probability of finding a six figure salary job on here or any other platform actually is slim to none. If you do find it, it's highly like that the listing was posted by you guessed it- an agency or care specialist on behalf of the family. This is because most families who pay that amount of money outsource the task of interviewing and vetting candidates to agencies. So, it's unlikely for one to find such positon on his or her own for aforementioned reasons; among others...\n\nRegarding the agency your former employer used, I'll play the \"devil's advocate\" and say that the agency did not do anything wrong though they could have done something differently. First, they fulfilled their end of the deal by finding, interviewing, vetting and placing a candidate- You. A lot of resources like time and money goes into these things. So, it's unfair and unrealistic to expect anyone- agency or not- to not get paid for their work because a client's situation changed. \n\nAnother way to look at this is- imagine you're waiting to get paid for the week or month and your boss says, I'm sorry I can't or I won't pay you because I just got fired from my own job or I lost a loved one. Do you think that's acceptable? Probably not. We all deserve to get paid for our hard work... simple as that. Now, the agency could have shown some grace and humanity by returning even a small portion of the fee to the family. Such an act is what sets the wheat apart from the chaff... \n\nUchechukwu"

I had not applied to his job posting, and when i did view his posting it was very vague and did not list what days/times care is needed, pay, or for how long.  I said I wasn't available until the following week ( to buy time to get a feel for things). A week later, he wanted to meet up, sent me an address, and told me \" You can come to our place to meet baby ____\". I explained that for all interviews, I meet  up in a public place and asked if there is a nearby coffee shop or other area we could meet at. He said because of the weather (it was a bit chilly but not very cold) he didn't want to take his daughter outside, and said we'd \"try again some other time\". I simply did not reply, as there were multiple red flags that this was possibly a dangerous situation. I am wondering if anyone has had a similar experience, and what further measures should I be taking to ensure my safety? I have since been messaged by two accounts that have clearly been from scammers, saying they'll pay me $30/hr and asking me to email them, then deleting their accounts minutes after sending the message (and I am then unable to report the account)."

	"text": "I could write a novel on the number of times that\u2019s happened to me and it is frustrating that my time is being wasted without compensation; too bad I can\u2019t charge a fee for absence of manners and professionalism.\n\nA few things to consider:\n1. When the family is reaching out to you for a position you didn\u2019t apply for, there\u2019s a possibility they might not be able to reply to your follow-up message because at least one party in exchange needs a premium membership to continue conversation using care.com messaging system.  If both parties have a basic membership, then the conversation can\u2019t continue beyond application or family inquiry.  Anytime I get an inquiry from a family, I include my personal e-mail address in response message to provide a means of communication in the event they are unable to continue conversation through care.com system.  If I don\u2019t hear back from said family after three days (e-mail or care.com message), I block them because odds are, they can\u2019t effectively balance their personal life along with task of responsible household employer; technology has many conveniences like voice to text so if they can\u2019t even take 10 seconds to send a one sentence update on status of position/inquiry, they\u2019re not a good fit.\n\n2. Steps to take to improve the odds besides persistence are polishing up appearance of profile with proper spelling, grammar, highlight of skills, experience, certification, education, and unique skills/qualities that sets you apart from competition.  During the application process, include all of the above and acknowledge details from job posting on what family is looking for to show you have read the description.\n\nAs you said, the industry is a big competition and numbers game so keep persisting until you land a job and when you get an offer, get everything in writing to cover your bases and prevent inconveniences that could end up putting you in a difficult position.  There are topics here on community platformwith  links to contracts you can modify to include your policies that families will be legally bound by contract and any breach in contract will result in prosecution which in turn hinders their credibility as a dependable household employer especially if their name ends up on public records; no self-respecting caregiver will want to work for someone like that. If memory serves, I believe one such link is www.lawdepot.com and I would like to acknowledge Christine for sharing valuable link for all that may benefit from it."

I think that families are dumb when it comes to care they expect for their loved ones.......I did live in work and now will never go back to it ever!  I get paid by the hour now or charge a flat rate for a 24 hr stint and even at that the family always wins!  I say that because just think if they had to pay an assisted living facility for their loved one?  Also, the family always seems to gloat when it comes to how you are treated and paid cuz they think of you as a perpetual slave.............I had a situation several times whereby I thought I was being fair to the family by living in and only asking for a monthly stipend in addition to the room and board which means you eat three square meals daily.  Granted you may only have toast and coffee for bkfst, but a good hearty meal involves vegetables and fruits aside from  protein.  My room value was always around $700 per month.  By law you are required 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep.  How many hours are there left in a 24 hr. day?  Figure 19 hrs. times the pay they said you would get per hour and then subtract the  $700 you owe them for rent and then go figure?  How is it possible you would not get more than a hundred a week?  Get out of there....you are a sucker like I was for many families.  I did it all those years because I am Christian and thought I was being a help................hell....I was being a door mat.  Get out !"

	"text": "Charge hourly for when you work. And I mean *any* work. Any time where you are not free to do whatever you want. If you are assisting with the kids on the plane, that\u2019s working. If you\u2019re out to dinner with them helping with the kids, that counts as working. If you\u2019re in your own room but are monitoring the baby monitor, that\u2019s working. If you have to share a room, charge around the clock. On second thought, don\u2019t accept if you have to share a room. I wouldn\u2019t do it, no way. \nDo not look at them providing your travel expenses as a favor to you. It\u2019s a business trip and it\u2019s to be expected. They\u2019re not just being nice. Many families think they\u2019re giving their nanny a free vacation but it\u2019s not; it\u2019s a business trip. You\u2019re not on vacation if you\u2019re working. I don\u2019t know why so many families can\u2019t get that in their heads. They should cover every single cost except souvenirs. If they can\u2019t afford it, then they can\u2019t have that luxury. Period. \nMy contract states that when I travel, I will be paid my normal 35 hours a week unless I work more. If I work less than 35, then I will still get the pay for 35 hours. Some nannies charge an extra daily travel fee for the inconvenience, since they are out of the comfort of their home and it\u2019s typically a little more stressful working while traveling, than in the normal home environment. Also helps if you have like a dog or something you need to board while you\u2019re away. I don\u2019t have that in my contract but I have seen it before. \nTalk about pay and travel expenses, obviously. Then also talk about boundaries. If you don\u2019t want to be working the whole time, then you need to ask about having some time to yourself. I would ask for a schedule so you can make your own plans and you don\u2019t end up working constantly. If they just say you\u2019ll be have some time to yourself while you\u2019re there without any sort of proposed (even if it\u2019s not set) schedule, you may end up working all day every day. Ask about accommodations, too, like getting your own room and bathroom. \nIt can be more stressful to travel, and it is work, but it can also be a lot of fun. I hope you can make something work and have fun. Good luck!"

	"text": "Hi Elaina, \n\nYour response is spot on! Sometimes, when I reflect on my earlier years in the industry, I flinch at how much I actually put up with- I'm sure a lot of caregivers can relate to this. However, I am happy to be where I am today and I do credit some of those experiences with leading me to this place. Nevertheless, this cancellation issue sometimes strikes a nerve because too many families do this too often with no regards for how it affects their caregiver. One of the annoying things that used to happen to me often back then was I would be half way to a family's house and they would contact me to cancel. So, not only did I waste my time, I also lost out on some pretty pennies e.g. train fare (round trip) or gas/toll plus the money I was supposed to earn.  This sucked even more if I already told another family that I was unavailable because I was committed to the family that ended up canceling. Another unpleasant experience was with a family that paid me $10 an hour then had the nerve to ask me if they can pay me $5 an hour for date nights since their children would be asleep. That was a long time ago but that experience was one of the turning points for me. I said enough is enough and haven't turned back since. \n\nNow that I have a strict cancellation policy, surprise surprise, I hardly get any cancellations lol. When clients have to cancel, they do so apologetically or try to do it in advance so they can avoid the fee. Of course, I am aware that unexpected changes can spring up in life, so I am quite flexible  and reasonable. Nevertheless, I still make it a point that my time (privacy, etc.) ought to be respected because I absolutely do the same for them and go above and beyond for them as well. There are too many things broken in our industry and caregivers end up bearing some of the heaviest loads from this broken system. So, we really have to take charge of the movement by being the change and bringing the changes we wish to see... every little thing counts! Thanks again for sharing your valuable thoughts on this. It's always a pleasure to read your posts/responses! \n\nBest, \nUchechukwu"

If you are in a desperate situation and for example just need that $45 for gas money then by all means go for it what time is money and money is time. Personally if I had to drive one way 45 minutes and make the return trip plus my service is offered while at the clients house my time would not be less than $100 depending on the hours there. I would pay myself at least a $0.50 a mile so it's equivalent 2 a dollar amount round trip plus the time at the location. Remember your plumber or electrician charges you typically a $75 to $99 trip fee or more to come out to Moe's locations so why shouldn't you do the same. I charge a standard $75 trip fee for any locations outside of my 15-minute radius. But again sometimes your back is against the wall with what you want to do and what you can actually financially afford to do so apply as applicable to your particular situation."

If it needs taken care of and it wasn't apart of the agreement I bring it to their attention and say that it needs to be done but if they're wanting me to do it then there will be an added fee of such and such. Now if it's the vacuum needs emptied then that's just what needs done when done sweeping but if it is something like it needed taken apart and unclogged then they are reliable because for one I'm not getting blamed if something goes wrong with it when attempting to unclog it and having to replace and two I'm not a handy man I'm a housekeeper so if it needs something like that they need to have it taken care of by someone else. I'm pretty blantly clear when it comes to this sort of thing though and make sure that when we're making a contract or agreement up that I state if extra things have to be done they will be told at the end of the workday and if it still needs attention the next workday then it will be extra that same day for my pay. Now with that being said everyone is different and this falls into why I do no want to use my own equipment because I don't want to put the wear and tear on my items I use at my home. Not to mention some people have animals and don't take care of their needs with fleas and such."

It irritates me to no end when employers expect employees to be available for varied amount of days and hours. I see this with large employers like well-known grocery store chains, too. People have lives and need to work enough to live. So, especially when they do not fulfill their initial offer, they have no right to expect even more. If you had known, I\u2019m bet you would have declined the offer or charged a higher on call rate. \n\nIt seems very odd, to me, she hunted you down on Facebook vs contacting you via Care.com. I suppose to save money by avoiding the membership fee. Sorry this happened to you. I suggest you either ask for a termination letter or email her stating what your understanding is for why you were let go.

Both families would need to pay a minimum of $11 per hour which would be $22 per hour for the caregiver. The caregiver should start from minimum wage then add to the rate depending on skills, education, amount of children etc. There are two nannies in my group. They make  $28 and $30 per hour for a nanny-share. Minimum wage is $12 per hour here in California. That was the base fee, then they raised it after factoring in their experience, certifications, etc. and came up with a rate that was good for each of them. Calculating 2/3 of your rate doesn't always work. I know some who do it that way and that's their choice, but there is also the law that states both families need pay the caregiver at least minimum wage. Some caregivers are already way underpaid and that irks me. They need to learn how to be treated fairly and paid properly. \nRespectfully, your VP. \ud83d\ude0a KK"

(Parents are home the first and last half hour of the day.) The rest of the time I\u2019m with the 2yr old. I\u2019m responsible for all the children\u2019s laundry being washed and folded and put away in its proper spots. Morning cleanup includes the kitchen dishes/dishwasher, sweeping and picking up toys spread throughout their house. The mom wants me to try to either do homework or baths. In the morning I\u2019m meant to do hair. Other than that it\u2019s no cleaning as they have weekly people to do that. Meals are just to be reheated since they cook on their own.\n\nDoing laundry may not seem like a lot but they each have an extremely large amount of clothes. And they go through 2-3 clothing changes a day. It\u2019s pjs and regular clothes. They don\u2019t have enough room to place all their clothes in their closets and drawers and mom seems to think I\u2019m supposed to just know who\u2019s clothes belongs to whom when some are transitioning and can share sizes. Which makes putting them away a complete headache and task of its own.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t mind doing hair but the mom spazzed out one morning and literally yelled at me (I haven\u2019t seen her yell at her kids like that, just me and her husband) she told me not to brush one of her son\u2019s hair with the detangler brush and only use the comb and then make finger curls. The boy is adopted, mixed race, black and something else. Parents are both white and I\u2019m black. My brother has the exact same hair except his it\u2019s more dense. I understand you being a parent but trying to explain hair to me, a black woman who wears her natural hair curly..I digress. Mainly my point is to say the mom is intense and I don\u2019t know if I will last the 6 months like projected while they continue their search to find a new live in nanny. \n\nI explained I can do homework but I don\u2019t want to do baths especially since there\u2019s not enough time and for this family I don\u2019t feel most comfortable giving the kids baths since they each have their own set of issues. My specialty is coursework anyways. \n\nNow to my real question. I\u2019m currently being paid 20$/hr flat no OT (not an issue) I have enough to do with the 2yr old is sleeping, which he only sleeps for about 1hr or if I can get him back down a second time another 1hr. If I have to watch the whole gang ages 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 I\u2019m not going to get much done since they all (allll) require supervision. The parents allow the two oldest to go to the park alone. I don\u2019t and will never, even though it\u2019s across the street.\n\nI\u2019m used to doing 3 siblings max at $25hr but I never did anything aside for actually babysitting them and making a snack while they sat at the table. I have 10y+ paid experience and I\u2019m CPR certified. I normally have never needed a contract since I\u2019m okay with it ending overnight. Maybe I should do one specifically to say what I will and won\u2019t do? \n\nWhat should I charge for all 5? Should I add an hourly fee if kids begin to be sick and home more than once? Normally, I\u2019m cut and dry with what I allow and do in the beginning but this family switched it up with me after I began. And I don\u2019t necessarily want to quit, but I can if needed. This is just to keep myself busy. (Thanks for reading it all or at least skimming it!)"

Also my advice for a future.....make sure from the very beginning what will be your responsibilities, your pay and dont ever, I mean.....ever stay longer than 6 hours. It's a labor job. We dont seat in front of computer with coffee and doughnuts for 8 hours, we work hard every minute and we have to be paid well. You always must tell them what type of cleaning you will provide, either deep or general and you have to set a rate for it. Work only for those people who can afford having a housekeeper. I never set myself up with any poor people that wanna take advantage of me and not pay me. Please report this account and give us the name so we all can see who did that to you and avoid this people! Thank you for sharing."

I chickened out of my first interview and told her I wasn\u2019t feeling week because I just had a bad feeling, but that could just be anxiety. \nAny tips for an interview/meet up to discuss. \nI got back to the woman who contacted me and requested we meet at a coffee shop, sit talk about pay, what\u2019s expect, how frequent, and so on. I feel that should be fine? I always worked under a private owned operation and usually had one other person with me. But when I didn\u2019t if my boss was uncomfortable with the individual I wouldn\u2019t go alone. I\u2019m just nervous and anxious about everything. Until I\u2019m truly comfortable or trust I\u2019m mostly safe I back out at the last minute. \nSo any advice on what exactly should happen at this meet up. And is there any possible way to be able to tell a scammer at all. Or just a meet up?"

If you have already accepted a flat rate, implement a late fee where you switch to hourly if parents are at least half an hour later than the time which they agreed to. Flat rates may be easier for the family, but for caregivers, they\u2019re pretty much only good for overnights."

Be wary of potential employers saying they'll pay you up front, cash a check for them, they are from out of town moving to the area, they'll pay you in advance, they want you to buy stuff for them with a portion of the money from a check they'll send you, and they want to hire you without an interview.  Also be wary of possible human traffickers. If you dont notice any red flags,....meet your potentisl emploers at a public place like a coffee shop to do an interview. Continue to follow your intuition on possible jobs. If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. Go with your instinct,. God bless you."
