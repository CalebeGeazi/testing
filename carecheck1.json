	"text": "If you're referring to paying for the premium membership, that does not guarantee you get a job through Care.  That just allows you to communicate with the families you apply to, puts you higher in the search results, and allows you to be notified of jobs in your area. If you're referring to paying for background checks, that's optional, not necessary, and each caregiver's decision to make. I've never paid for a background check. I usually let the prospective employer request a background check through Care. That way it's at the prospective employer's expense, not mine. The CareCheck that caregivers are now required to do in order to use the website is free. It sounds like you were overcharged for a service. I'm glad you were able to recoup some of your money. I understand your frustration, but Care is not a scam. Care is basically a business to help families and caregivers connect. There may be many caregivers applying for the same job that you are applying to . Acquiring a good job takes patience and hard work. This is a competive field. We need to make sure we have a clear and informative profile/bio, knowledgeable experience, certain certifications, excellent references and reviews, a positive attitude, and patience. Keep applying to all of the jobs that fit your needs and schedule. I hope you continue to be diligent in your search and find a family that will be a perfect fit for you. You can try contacting nanny agencies in your area. I have found them to be very helpful and have acquired two jobs through an agency. Good luck! \nAll the best to you,\n\ud83d\ude0a Kelly K"

The CareCheck is a nationwide background check while a lot of the background checks that we caregivers already have are only statewide checks. People outside of the company (Sterling Talent) that Care uses to preform the background checks will not see your SSN. It's ultimately your choice. I hope you choose to do it. You'll receive your CareCheck badge on your profile so prospective employers can see that you've had a background check."

I\u2019ve always provided my clients my background check via my local law enforcement agency without any issues.  I\u2019ve had my CNA license for over 25 years and I\u2019m a well seasoned caregiver in addition smart and grown enough to handle my own affairs.  I recently was informed that I needed to get my Care check and thought \u201cok let me check it out\u201d yes they ask for your #ssn and immediately I said no I\u2019m very skeptical with submitting my personal info over a website that may or may not be secure.  I talked it over with my husband and he convinced me that it was ok and I received the check.  I\u2019m not 100% ok with this and I\u2019m holding my breath at the moment..one of my concerns is that no where on this website does it list a contact number in case you need to discuss a issue with customer service/Care.com administrative assistance that I\u2019ve ran across.  And I have navigated all the pages...and I cannot even find anyway to send a email...or live chat and it seems to me if they advertise to be one of the worlds largest care community then that should be well established and in place on their website.   I actually went off the website and googled the contact info and got the number!!! But it is not listed on the website anywhere!  As far as the submitting our #ssn... I had a young lady on the discussion page telling us that it was absolutely secure! When in fact we know that nothing is absolute and I was amazed that there are individuals that believe it.  We are taking a chance to say the least..I love the Website and  it has given me the opportunity to work in my community for some great seniors for many years now.  Hope we don\u2019t wake up tomorrow and learn of a security breach!"

This is what I wish would be brought up at the \u201ctown hall\u201d. Feel free to list your grievances... within sanity:\n\nWhy can\u2019t caregivers leave families reviews? Airbnb allows both parties to give private feedback and then public feedback. But not allowing caregivers to leave reviews you are supported an unhealthy 1 sided power dynamic that families have been taking advantage of for years.\n\nMore needs to be done in terms of education when parents are hiring a nanny. From contracts, to legalities to, just plain old what your nanny is NOT...unless she also agrees to BE that and get paid for it(a full on housekeeper, a gourmet personal chef, a DOG SITTER). ALL things surrounding hiring a nanny. It\u2019s too simple for parents to just sign up and be on their way in their search. You all can be doing more! There are all these \u201cresources\u201d. They are not helping in this area and it\u2019s a constant battle. Can you please create some type of module or something. Maybe even make it where it\u2019s optional but then the parents who do complete the \u201ccourse\u201d get some sort of badge letting caregivers know that this family is actually wanting to put an effort into treating their caregiver fairly.\n\nYou need to do more on educating parents on pay, from the legalities to livable wages. This unregulated \u201cmarketplace\u201d is a large reason why caregivers are being taken advantage of left and right on pay. Some of these parents are acting like they are doing NOTHING wrong EVEN when they are informed that they are underpaying their nanny. They will willfully ignore what agencies say is a livable fair wage minimum for nannies in their area and blame it on everyone else because you are fostering an undervalued market. Does that make sense? Can you do NOTHING else to help in this area????\n\nCustomer service: WHY is it so hard phone people who have never called the phone number to find how to talk to someone. If we are going for the medal for places that make it the hardest for you to figure out how to reach a human well excellent job. I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s THAT hard to add a button an option for \u201cto speak with a customer service representative press...\u201d (btw, the option you all want to talk to a human here is \u201csafety center\u201d). When emailing I would like to get actually responses to the question I ask instead of canned replies that often times just BLATANTLY ignored what I asked.\n\nWebsite Glitches: I canNOT even with this one. Seriously?!\n\nSAFETY FOR CAREGIVERS!!!!!!!\nWe are going to these people\u2019s HOMES. Can we get SOME type of resource here. Now many people are being charged $14.99 for care checks. Fine. But what about the family side of things. Does something really awful have to happen to a caregiver on here before something is done to protect caregivers...like this whole care check thing came about on the family side."

Instead of directly saying: \u201cwe are no longer a free site,\u201d they took a less honorable, evasive and secrecy laden approach: \u201clook we are offering you a cool new service that will let families be happy,\u201d when in reality that\u2019s not beneficial to use caregivers at all. We will not be further protected at all. The families will only have people on the site who have the carebadge, so you\u2019re not standing out by having it. It\u2019s of no benefit. Had they come out and been upfront and real from the beginning, I would have respected them and trusted them. I certainly don\u2019t feel comfortable giving my SSN or Credit Card info to any company, retailer, person I do not trust. That is the issue I find with them, their dishonest approach.\n\nI contacted them directly and was told: \u201cthose with premium already pay for the screening, those without premium will need to pay for the screening,\u201d so anybody who did carecheck a month ago, be advised you will also need to pay, and they said: \u201ccarecheck will need to be updated each year,\u201d which is an indirect, misleading, evasive, secretive way of saying YOU WILL PAY EACH YEARLY for this site.\n\nWhen I first contacted care.com about the carecheck when it was first announced, which I feel is a front to transition the site to be paid membership only, I was directly quoted this in an email: \u201cThere is no cost to you for the CareCheck which includes:\u201d The magic words THERE IS NO COST TO YOU, and now there is suddenly a cost? What was free a month ago suddenly costs! Ha. Read the writing on the wall. Untrustworthy. Dishonorable. Dissembling. \n\nThat\u2019s my two cents. With the overabundance of scammers, and their \u201cwe are so concerned with safety\u201d that we took away CareChat, so now you must communicate via phone and email \u2014 makes it seem like I\u2019d be paying to use Craigslist! At least they anonymize my email (I actually have joined an agency in my area and have found GREAT SUCCESS using the Nextdoor app. Which reminds me care.com just asked me to rate them via AppleStore... why of course, perhaps I\u2019ll just copy paste this)!!\n\nGreat minds have said, when someone shows you who they are, believe them...\n\nCheers."

I don't know for sure but I assume that this new policy is because care.com has been sued on at least one occasion by families whose child was harmed by a caregiver initially contacted through care.com.  This is possibly an attempt by care.com to increase security and reduce liability. I absolutely support care.com in this effort.  I hope that eventually they will also do background checks on parents.  FYI,  I followed the care.com links related to this and found the following:\nWhat is a CareCheck?\nAs of July 2019, we have begun rolling out an enhanced caregiver screening to include a background check called a CareCheck. This process will take some time. We collect your legal name, permanent address, birth date, and Social Security Number so that our background check vendor, Sterling Talent Solutions, can run your CareCheck. There is no cost to you for the CareCheck which includes:\nSocial Security Number trace\nNational Sex Offender Public Website search\nMulti-jurisdictional criminal database search\nFederal and county criminal records search\nWhen your CareCheck is complete, your profile will display a CareCheck badge with the date that the last CareCheck was run. We ask for your patience as we work to complete this change through the remainder of this year. We expect to refresh CareChecks annually for caregivers who remain active on the Care.com platform\nWe do not run CareChecks on people looking for caregivers.\nEach of us will have to decide if this is something we can live with.  If not, understand that you will NOT be able to remain active on care.com.  Please, if you disagree with this policy, DO NOT take it out on me.  I am just the messenger and in the same situation as everyone else on this board."

You will just have a CareCheck badge on your profile saying that you've had a background check done through Care. No one sees your SS# except for the company running your background check. I've done my research. Sterling Talent, the company that runs the background checks, has never been hacked. It's up to you whether or not you want to do the free CareCheck, but I'm not sure you'll be able to use this site to find a job if you don't have the CareCheck on file. Care has been running background checks so they can have proof of who we are, that we can legally work in the U.S., and that we don't have a criminal record. It makes good sense for them to do this."

I've been a member for several years.  I never had a problem until the last year.   I notice they want everyone to \"upgrade\" to be able to communicate with whomever you are trying to reach.  I have not done that and refuse to.  Also I think there are \"fake\" people looking for caregivers.  All the descriptions sound the same, the hours are the same, and when I send a message to 10 people, for example, I MIGHT hear from one person.   Oh and those particular \"adds\" also don't provide a picture.  That's not a coincidence.  I have great credentials, good experience, I am professional and I look like a professional.  So I know something is up when I don't hear from so many people.  I'm sure care.com will not like when they see these comments, but we have to speak out.  This used to be a great service.  I think it's an improvement that they want us to do a carecheck up front, though.  That shows you guys that we don't have any scary things in our background (there are other levels of background checks.)    Maybe if they hear from enough people something will change.

With that; few people will message you and make sure to respond in 24hrs those things will boost you up to have a CAREPRO status so that parents can easily find you. Add a debit card on file for getting paid. With all of those being said, it won\u2019t guarantee you a job but at least you will be on top of a search list from parents. Update your calendar to put in your availabilities up to 4 weeks ahead.\nPay attention to the morning job email and apply to jobs (even if it\u2019s 50 jobs in a day). Yes I am on care since 2016 but I only landed 2 one time jobs and still help those families out on an occasional basis because I didn\u2019t know all of the above to start it off. And even now that I do, I have successes in other websites with more that 60+ reviews. Finding jobs in here is very hard and slim. Finally, wait for the alert to do the CARECHECK just to verify your identity.\nAPP: the app doesn\u2019t have all of the features, so your best bet is through the website with the desktop site and the mobile site because each one has something that\u2019s not found on the other. \nGood luck and keep searching from here and there."

I found my current job as live-in caretaker position through Craigslist.For the most part,it has worked out alright with the exception being when I was physically assaulted by one of client's friends.Lixin,with so many people out of work,measured in the tens of millions,it's important to conduct your job search with faith and positive mindset.This is what is going to keep you going when things get rough and start feeling depressed and maybe doubting yourself.I'll mention the following again:Check out the following websites:Care.com,Craigslist,Indeed.com and it's sister site,Simplyhired.com.Also,apply at local domestic worker/nanny agencies which can definitely be found on indeed.com.To put the odds in my favor,I recently did 3 things on care.com.Signed up for criminal background check,50 dollars,Signed up for Premium membership,45 dollars with promo code and includes free MVR and paid 15 dollars for Carecheck.Also,I advertise that I'm physically fit for heavy lifting which I am.Lixin,I just found out 2 days ago that care.com is offering free HHA course.Can't beat that!!! Also,make sure to visit these jobsites everday and different hours but dont get obsessive about it either! Also,you should go out of your way to get CPR card online or at a local business that offers these classes.Cost will be 20 to 55 dollars,no fooling.Also,if your flexible,apply for different job titles:Nanny,Senior Caretaker or even Housekeepers.Ive seen ads looking for female housekeepers/Cooks that pay well! Also,it seems more retail places are hiring,too.That's all I 've got right now.Good luck and stay strong."

I have not yet contacted care voicing my concerns but I will be. \n\n\nHi Gabby,\n\nIt\u2019s our mission to provide the best place to help caregivers like you find great jobs. Everyone now realizes what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 caregiving is critical to families and the services you provide are an essential part of our economy.\n\nRecently, we decided to increase our level of screening for caregivers to include a background check, called a CareCheck. This safety screening is an important step in our commitment to creating a safer Care.com community. With CareCheck, families will have a safer foundation to evaluate caregivers, and caregivers will be able to find jobs more quickly to provide essential care.\n\nAs a result, in order to participate on our platform, all caregivers will be charged a $14.99 fee, which will automatically renew annually. By getting a CareCheck, you'll not only show families you're serious about safety, but you'll continue to have access to all of the same great benefits you enjoy now as a Care.com member.\n\nWe hope you\u2019ll get a CareCheck and continue using Care.com to find high-quality, well-paying jobs. On behalf of everyone at Care.com, thank you for being an important part of our caregiving community.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nTim Allen\nCEO, Care.com"

I've done several background checks and have had no issues. No one outside of the company that does the background checks will see your SSN. Families will not get to see the results, only Care will see the results. The fact that you've had a CareCheck done will show as a badge on your profile, along with the date it was done. I understand your concern. Many of us caregivers have done the background checks and have had no issues. It's ultimately your choice as to whether or not you consent to the background check, but if you don't consent, eventually Care will not allow you to use their website."

I completely understand this is a safety protector on cares part, but if that\u2019s the case why wouldn\u2019t it be for all parties using the app?\n\nLet\u2019s be real for a minute. MOST families want to meet at their house so you can see the kids, be introduced to the routines etc. And sadly the world today is a crazy place. Someone may sound totally great on the phone, but you just can never know. Many of us are woman. Personally, I\u2019m a young woman in my twenties and petite. Walking alone in the parking lot is an unsettling feeling for many of us in today\u2019s day which is sad. But this is even going to someone\u2019s home. Of course I take all the precautions like trying to find the family on Facebook, meet in the day, phone interview first, tell my boyfriend to call if he doesn\u2019t here from me within the hour. I know I probably sound dramatic and don\u2019t want to scare anyone, but we do take a risk meeting with families the first time. \n\nYes these people are leaving their children with us but many of us are going to THEIR homes. \n\nI just personally can\u2019t see why there wouldn\u2019t be any kind of protection on our end. Yeah, you can\u2019t get background checks for everyone in the house, but just something to verify the parent with the account is better than nothing. \n\nSorry just had to throw in my two cents. I\u2019m not comfortable putting my SSN or any personal info in over the internet. This has always been a preference of mine and a rule I live by. I don\u2019t want to sound hypocritical since I won\u2019t be doing it, I\u2019m just trying to say it\u2019s not any safer for us than it is for them so the requirements should not be different. \n\nI feel super disappointed that caregivers will be required to do this in order to use the app anymore, but still no protection on our behalf. We\u2019re required to, but there\u2019s not even an OPTION for us to request one from them."

You can try 1 month premium with a promo code (~ $17) or $45 for up to 6 months by Facebooking them. The advantage of having the premium is to show up higher in the search result from parents, you get a free motor vehicle record check with the badge on your profile since the background check is expensive, but the CARECHECK is free and a plus too, you get the daily alert email to apply for jobs ahead of those that don\u2019t have the premium and you can message back and forth all the parents.\nYou can check out other topics in this platform relating to your concern. \nA premium still will not guarantee you a job ASAP but it can be helpful since there are other factors mentioned above that go into finding a job.

In the meantime I would be billed every month..  You think that is fair to caregivers who are in need of work?   I have done interviews with clients in the past on this site and if they liked me and wanted to hire me they go and do their own Background checks on me and get references from people I let them call from previous job.  Not everyone wants to give their personal information out to  a site.  Also the people who need caregivers are being blocked as well.  People use this site because its simple, pay your money.  Make an application for a job or caregiver.  Why? Because nursing homes are Expensive and they cant afford it.  Because they live on a simple social or pension.  Agencies cost a lot for them and are too complicated.  I know.  So they rely on a private caregiver.  However the caregiver has no protection so they have to be careful as well And make suitable choices.  Either way whether or not you do a care check Your site can't protect Anyone!

I've been paying my membership dues and had no issues with Care or the individuals I've tutored. I do not do it as my primary source of income but do so as a side gigs from time to time.\n\n At the same time, I recently got notified by Care that everyone will have to go through background checks from now on. I understand where parents are coming from as wanting background checks for the nanny or caregivers who go to their home. At least, in my case, I've never had direct contact with the students(most of them who are adults in college) since I have tutored them online and many times with high school students with their parents present and with the ability to record lessons.\n\nI prefer the previous system where parents could request a tutor to get a background check, especially if the given caregiver(most of the time nanny) was going to go to their house and be with their children for extend periods times. However, in my case and I'm sure in others as well, who mainly tutor math online for one hour once a week, it seems like a little too much. \n\n Does this mean that those who no do not go through Care check, despite having reviews, will no longer show in the listing results, or will it mean that they will no longer have the ability to contact students?  \n\nPlease, be respectful in your replies. I wholeheartedly sympathize with parents.  At the same time, I think that different caregivers and tutors are offering very distinct services. Caregivers are taking Care of the children for extended periods and should be verified. Meanwhile, tutors are teaching a technical subject like math to college students(adults). And specific policies should apply in a case by case basis."

It usually is the result of parents trying to take the cheap way out and hiring someone who really doesn\u2019t have the necessary training and experience to be able to fully care for a severely disabled person. It is so much harder than taking care of children, but because the parents have dealt over the years with these changing and increasing needs, they don\u2019t see how much more complicated the care is becoming. And even when the disabled adult is becoming frustrated and mean, the parents are always going to take their child side and not be understanding of the caregivers impatience or frustrations."

	"text": "Hi Azriel! Welcome to the community. The free background check is called CareCheck. The CareCheck is Care's way of making sure you are who you say you are, you can work legally in the U.S, and you do not have a criminal record. The CareCheck will only show up as a badge on your profile. You will not be able to share it with your employers. Care will send you an email when you need to do this. \nIf you're referring to the free MVR (Motor Vehicle Record) background check, that is free with the purchase of the premium membership. \nI never pay for my background checks. I usually let the prospective employer request a background check through Care. That way it's at their expense, not mine. \nI hope this wasn't too confusing. It's still early for me. \ud83d\ude02 Good luck in your search. \ud83d\ude0a KK"

	"text": "Hi Rachel, to answer your questions below-\nThe CareCheck results are not made public and you cannot share them on your profile. The Criminal+MVR background checks that you or a prospective employer purchases are stored on your profile. A prospective employer can request to view it and you will need to grant them access to it. Also, keep in mind that Trustline background checks are not as thorough as the background checks on Care. Trustline only searches statewide. The company that does the Care background checks search nationwide. Some families prefer a more thorough background check. Every family is different. It's not mandatory for you to purchase an background check. I had a family request a background check and they paid for it, actually the company that the father worked for paid for it. If the family wants it, you can let them incur the expense. The background check will stay on your profile and expire after 6 months. Good luck to you!"

By upgrading to premium which is $20 a month or less, and you can cancel it after the first month if you have gotten a job, you will see new jobs first before people who have not paid for premium. The care check is free. Also you cannot communicate with people if neither of you is a paying member. I don\u2019t give people consent to see my background check (care always ask your permission before giving it to someone) until I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a person I\u2019d want to work with. With the care check they cannot see any of your personal information but they will know that care.com has verified what you are. I always communicate a bit back-and-forth and do a phone interview before we get into background checks, and then the employer pays for the background check since they will want an up-to-date one anyhow."

It is mandatory at this point because they need to just verify that people are who they say they are so they can reassure parents that you\u2019re for real. Do not pay for the background checks yourself. If a family is interested in hiring you they can do the background check and pay for it themselves. The background check is only good for six months anyhow and parents will generally want to do their own who really care about having one. The Parents can just request a background check from care.com, then care.com will send you a message asking permission to run your background check for them. If you get a request for a background check from someone you have not been communicating with at all, do not approve it."

I've never had an issue with any of the background checks or my personal info. being used in an unprofessional manner.

I was nervous to give out my SSN, too. Everything turned out okay for me. I'm sure it will for you, too. Care needs the CareCheck from us to prove who we are. It's that simple.

I'm sure you can find a family who will not require a background check, but I'm not sure if Care will require everyone to do the CareCheck eventually.
