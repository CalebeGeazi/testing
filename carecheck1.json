The Criminal+MVR background checks that you or a prospective employer purchases are stored on your profile. A prospective employer can request to view it and you will need to grant them access to it. Also, keep in mind that Trustline background checks are not as thorough as the background checks on Care. Trustline only searches statewide. The company that does the Care background checks search nationwide. Some families prefer a more thorough background check. Every family is different. It's not mandatory for you to purchase an background check. I had a family request a background check and they paid for it, actually the company that the father worked for paid for it. If the family wants it, you can let them incur the expense. The background check will stay on your profile and expire after 6 months. Good luck to you!"

CareCheck is for Care's purposes, mainly to identity who you are and if you have any \n\"issues\" in your background that would prevent you from being a caregiver. The background check that you purchase will stay on your profile for 6 months and you will be able to share it with prospective employers. \nBest regards,\n😊 Kelly K"

I completely understand this is a safety protector on cares part, but if that’s the case why wouldn’t it be for all parties using the app?\n\nLet’s be real for a minute. MOST families want to meet at their house so you can see the kids, be introduced to the routines etc. And sadly the world today is a crazy place. Someone may sound totally great on the phone, but you just can never know. Many of us are woman. Personally, I’m a young woman in my twenties and petite. Walking alone in the parking lot is an unsettling feeling for many of us in today’s day which is sad. But this is even going to someone’s home. Of course I take all the precautions like trying to find the family on Facebook, meet in the day, phone interview first, tell my boyfriend to call if he doesn’t here from me within the hour. I know I probably sound dramatic and don’t want to scare anyone, but we do take a risk meeting with families the first time. \n\nYes these people are leaving their children with us but many of us are going to THEIR homes. \n\nI just personally can’t see why there wouldn’t be any kind of protection on our end. Yeah, you can’t get background checks for everyone in the house, but just something to verify the parent with the account is better than nothing. \n\nSorry just had to throw in my two cents. I’m not comfortable putting my SSN or any personal info in over the internet. This has always been a preference of mine and a rule I live by. I don’t want to sound hypocritical since I won’t be doing it, I’m just trying to say it’s not any safer for us than it is for them so the requirements should not be different. \n\nI feel super disappointed that caregivers will be required to do this in order to use the app anymore, but still no protection on our behalf. We’re required to, but there’s not even an OPTION for us to request one from them."

    "content": "Lucia I felt the same way.  I have been using this site for a few years now.  I’ve always provided my clients my background check via my local law enforcement agency without any issues.  I’ve had my CNA license for over 25 years and I’m a well seasoned caregiver in addition smart and grown enough to handle my own affairs.  I recently was informed that I needed to get my Care check and thought “ok let me check it out” yes they ask for your #ssn and immediately I said no I’m very skeptical with submitting my personal info over a website that may or may not be secure.  I talked it over with my husband and he convinced me that it was ok and I received the check.  I’m not 100% ok with this and I’m holding my breath at the moment..one of my concerns is that no where on this website does it list a contact number in case you need to discuss a issue with customer service/Care.com administrative assistance that I’ve ran across.  And I have navigated all the pages...and I cannot even find anyway to send a email...or live chat and it seems to me if they advertise to be one of the worlds largest care community then that should be well established and in place on their website.   I actually went off the website and googled the contact info and got the number!!! But it is not listed on the website anywhere!  As far as the submitting our #ssn... I had a young lady on the discussion page telling us that it was absolutely secure! When in fact we know that nothing is absolute and I was amazed that there are individuals that believe it.  We are taking a chance to say the least..I love the Website and  it has given me the opportunity to work in my community for some great seniors for many years now.  Hope we don’t wake up tomorrow and learn of a security breach!"

They have many caregivers online, so it's impossible to do the CareChecks on everyone all at once. Care just implemented the CareCheck last summer, so it may take some time to get to you. Those caregivers who refuse to do the CareCheck will eventually not be able to use the website. If you're concerned about giving out your SSN, you should read care.com's privacy policy. They do not give your personal information to anyone."

That just allows you to communicate with the families you apply to, puts you higher in the search results, and allows you to be notified of jobs in your area. If you're referring to paying for background checks, that's optional, not necessary, and each caregiver's decision to make. I've never paid for a background check. I usually let the prospective employer request a background check through Care. That way it's at the prospective employer's expense, not mine. The CareCheck that caregivers are now required to do in order to use the website is free. It sounds like you were overcharged for a service. I'm glad you were able to recoup some of your money. I understand your frustration, but Care is not a scam. Care is basically a business to help families and caregivers connect. There may be many caregivers applying for the same job that you are applying to . Acquiring a good job takes patience and hard work. This is a competive field. We need to make sure we have a clear and informative profile/bio, knowledgeable experience, certain certifications, excellent references and reviews, a positive attitude, and patience. Keep applying to all of the jobs that fit your needs and schedule. I hope you continue to be diligent in your search and find a family that will be a perfect fit for you. You can try contacting nanny agencies in your area. I have found them to be very helpful and have acquired two jobs through an agency. Good luck! \nAll the best to you,\n😊 Kelly K"

    "content": "Hi there.  You're not the only one frustrated.  I've seen a couple comments from other caregivers, too, saying they were not receiving communication BACK from people in need of caregivers.  I've been a member for several years.  I never had a problem until the last year.   I notice they want everyone to \"upgrade\" to be able to communicate with whomever you are trying to reach.  I have not done that and refuse to.  Also I think there are \"fake\" people looking for caregivers.  All the descriptions sound the same, the hours are the same, and when I send a message to 10 people, for example, I MIGHT hear from one person.   Oh and those particular \"adds\" also don't provide a picture.  That's not a coincidence.  I have great credentials, good experience, I am professional and I look like a professional.  So I know something is up when I don't hear from so many people.  I'm sure care.com will not like when they see these comments, but we have to speak out.  This used to be a great service.  I think it's an improvement that they want us to do a carecheck up front, though.  That shows you guys that we don't have any scary things in our background (there are other levels of background checks.)    Maybe if they hear from enough people something will change.

I have done interviews with clients in the past on this site and if they liked me and wanted to hire me they go and do their own Background checks on me and get references from people I let them call from previous job.  Not everyone wants to give their personal information out to  a site.  Also the people who need caregivers are being blocked as well.  People use this site because its simple, pay your money.  Make an application for a job or caregiver.  Why? Because nursing homes are Expensive and they cant afford it.  Because they live on a simple social or pension.  Agencies cost a lot for them and are too complicated.  I know.  So they rely on a private caregiver.  However the caregiver has no protection so they have to be careful as well And make suitable choices.  Either way whether or not you do a care check Your site can't protect Anyone!

I've been paying my membership dues and had no issues with Care or the individuals I've tutored. I do not do it as my primary source of income but do so as a side gigs from time to time.\n\n At the same time, I recently got notified by Care that everyone will have to go through background checks from now on. I understand where parents are coming from as wanting background checks for the nanny or caregivers who go to their home. At least, in my case, I've never had direct contact with the students(most of them who are adults in college) since I have tutored them online and many times with high school students with their parents present and with the ability to record lessons.\n\nI prefer the previous system where parents could request a tutor to get a background check, especially if the given caregiver(most of the time nanny) was going to go to their house and be with their children for extend periods times. However, in my case and I'm sure in others as well, who mainly tutor math online for one hour once a week, it seems like a little too much. \n\n Does this mean that those who no do not go through Care check, despite having reviews, will no longer show in the listing results, or will it mean that they will no longer have the ability to contact students?  \n\nPlease, be respectful in your replies. I wholeheartedly sympathize with parents.  At the same time, I think that different caregivers and tutors are offering very distinct services. Caregivers are taking Care of the children for extended periods and should be verified. Meanwhile, tutors are teaching a technical subject like math to college students(adults). And specific policies should apply in a case by case basis."

Instead of directly saying: “we are no longer a free site,” they took a less honorable, evasive and secrecy laden approach: “look we are offering you a cool new service that will let families be happy,” when in reality that’s not beneficial to use caregivers at all. We will not be further protected at all. The families will only have people on the site who have the carebadge, so you’re not standing out by having it. It’s of no benefit. Had they come out and been upfront and real from the beginning, I would have respected them and trusted them. I certainly don’t feel comfortable giving my SSN or Credit Card info to any company, retailer, person I do not trust. That is the issue I find with them, their dishonest approach.\n\nI contacted them directly and was told: “those with premium already pay for the screening, those without premium will need to pay for the screening,” so anybody who did carecheck a month ago, be advised you will also need to pay, and they said: “carecheck will need to be updated each year,” which is an indirect, misleading, evasive, secretive way of saying YOU WILL PAY EACH YEARLY for this site.\n\nWhen I first contacted care.com about the carecheck when it was first announced, which I feel is a front to transition the site to be paid membership only, I was directly quoted this in an email: “There is no cost to you for the CareCheck which includes:” The magic words THERE IS NO COST TO YOU, and now there is suddenly a cost? What was free a month ago suddenly costs! Ha. Read the writing on the wall. Untrustworthy. Dishonorable. Dissembling. \n\nThat’s my two cents. With the overabundance of scammers, and their “we are so concerned with safety” that we took away CareChat, so now you must communicate via phone and email — makes it seem like I’d be paying to use Craigslist! At least they anonymize my email (I actually have joined an agency in my area and have found GREAT SUCCESS using the Nextdoor app. Which reminds me care.com just asked me to rate them via AppleStore... why of course, perhaps I’ll just copy paste this)!!\n\nGreat minds have said, when someone shows you who they are, believe them...\n\nCheers."

The background check is only good for six months anyhow and parents will generally want to do their own who really care about having one. The Parents can just request a background check from care.com, then care.com will send you a message asking permission to run your background check for them. If you get a request for a background check from someone you have not been communicating with at all, do not approve it."

A town hall is a setting where actual people are gathered and are allowed to ask questions that are not pre-screened.  Yeah, yeah, the virus...no common sense there,  either.  \nThey have never been clear about this care check, and asking for a social and a credit card sends me lots of red flags.  \nOT, I do love the real Tim Allen."

I found my current job as live-in caretaker position through Craigslist.For the most part,it has worked out alright with the exception being when I was physically assaulted by one of client's friends.Lixin,with so many people out of work,measured in the tens of millions,it's important to conduct your job search with faith and positive mindset.This is what is going to keep you going when things get rough and start feeling depressed and maybe doubting yourself.I'll mention the following again:Check out the following websites:Care.com,Craigslist,Indeed.com and it's sister site,Simplyhired.com.Also,apply at local domestic worker/nanny agencies which can definitely be found on indeed.com.To put the odds in my favor,I recently did 3 things on care.com.Signed up for criminal background check,50 dollars,Signed up for Premium membership,45 dollars with promo code and includes free MVR and paid 15 dollars for Carecheck.Also,I advertise that I'm physically fit for heavy lifting which I am.Lixin,I just found out 2 days ago that care.com is offering free HHA course.Can't beat that!!! Also,make sure to visit these jobsites everday and different hours but dont get obsessive about it either! Also,you should go out of your way to get CPR card online or at a local business that offers these classes.Cost will be 20 to 55 dollars,no fooling.Also,if your flexible,apply for different job titles:Nanny,Senior Caretaker or even Housekeepers.Ive seen ads looking for female housekeepers/Cooks that pay well! Also,it seems more retail places are hiring,too.That's all I 've got right now.Good luck and stay strong."

Guess what I was the SECOND profile listed, never paid premium a day, did not have the care check at the time, 1 review. Scrolled through about 10 pages to see the other profiles. Soooooo many pages of profiles far down with many reviews, background checks on file, etc. People who really do pay should be mad. And I verified by having a friend of mine search too.

    "content": "I appreciate that this service exists and have met a few lovely families but like anything I feel that there is room for improvement. This is what I wish would be brought up at the “town hall”. Feel free to list your grievances... within sanity:\n\nWhy can’t caregivers leave families reviews? Airbnb allows both parties to give private feedback and then public feedback. But not allowing caregivers to leave reviews you are supported an unhealthy 1 sided power dynamic that families have been taking advantage of for years.\n\nMore needs to be done in terms of education when parents are hiring a nanny. From contracts, to legalities to, just plain old what your nanny is NOT...unless she also agrees to BE that and get paid for it(a full on housekeeper, a gourmet personal chef, a DOG SITTER). ALL things surrounding hiring a nanny. It’s too simple for parents to just sign up and be on their way in their search. You all can be doing more! There are all these “resources”. They are not helping in this area and it’s a constant battle. Can you please create some type of module or something. Maybe even make it where it’s optional but then the parents who do complete the “course” get some sort of badge letting caregivers know that this family is actually wanting to put an effort into treating their caregiver fairly.\n\nYou need to do more on educating parents on pay, from the legalities to livable wages. This unregulated “marketplace” is a large reason why caregivers are being taken advantage of left and right on pay. Some of these parents are acting like they are doing NOTHING wrong EVEN when they are informed that they are underpaying their nanny. They will willfully ignore what agencies say is a livable fair wage minimum for nannies in their area and blame it on everyone else because you are fostering an undervalued market. Does that make sense? Can you do NOTHING else to help in this area????\n\nCustomer service: WHY is it so hard phone people who have never called the phone number to find how to talk to someone. If we are going for the medal for places that make it the hardest for you to figure out how to reach a human well excellent job. I really don’t think it’s THAT hard to add a button an option for “to speak with a customer service representative press...” (btw, the option you all want to talk to a human here is “safety center”). When emailing I would like to get actually responses to the question I ask instead of canned replies that often times just BLATANTLY ignored what I asked.\n\nWebsite Glitches: I canNOT even with this one. Seriously?!\n\nSAFETY FOR CAREGIVERS!!!!!!!\nWe are going to these people’s HOMES. Can we get SOME type of resource here. Now many people are being charged $14.99 for care checks. Fine. But what about the family side of things. Does something really awful have to happen to a caregiver on here before something is done to protect caregivers...like this whole care check thing came about on the family side."
