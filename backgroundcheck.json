Fast forward to now, I came back to care.com with a different profile/email (wanted to start fresh), I was browsing through jobs and came across a perfect for for me. After applying and waiting two days, I finally got a reply back from said man. As I went back to the job description, the job was starting to look familiar, even the profile picture of one of the girls looked familiar to me. He requested a background check through Care but I have a feeling it's the same person from a couple of years ago with the same profile. Any advise? ."

My pay rate is $15-25 so I get why I\u2019m getting the $10-15 jobs on my page due to the $15 yet parents be like all I can afford is $10-12, so why not put $10-12 or your exact pay you can afford. All my other apps they can only add the amount they can pay and I can only add my exact amount so care.com need to do better with this due to us taking our time to read over jobs and applying just for the parent to say $15 is too much yet they put $15.\n\nAlso, when parents hire someone, it should be care.com to close the job, since I\u2019m paying every month to apply to jobs, I don\u2019t wanna hear we have to do background checks, well that\u2019s not every month, no business does that and I\u2019m a business owner. \n\nLastly, parents need to stop asking for good care when they only offering $10-15 to take care of multiple children. That\u2019s a lot of work to do, and the they want you to be a maid as well, that\u2019s two separate jobs when cleaning up more than the children\u2019s mess. Lastly, we should be able to give reviews on these parents as well other people need to know what they are getting into before accepting a job."

You and the parents can message each other back and forth, you get the early mornings email to apply for jobs ahead of those that don\u2019t have the premium, you get a free motor vehicle record check (in case you can\u2019t afford just the background check alone which is $33), you can look up your stats to see if parents are looking at your own profile or not, you will also appear on the higher search lists of parents, and if you add a debit card on file, have 3 reviews on your profile front the people that you know well, on top of messaging parents within 24hrs, you get their Carepro status. Premium is just $20/mo or $50/6mo. You can get a discount if you email them on Facebook.\nDefinitely worth it! We spend more on clothes, shoes, phone, food, therefore I don\u2019t fee this small fee will bankrupt you. However, keep in mind that the premium alone doesn\u2019t guarantee you a job. It will depend on your location, education (degrees), certifications(CPR...), years of experiences, what the job entails, how many kids you will be dealing with and their age matter too and if you are familiar with special needed kids or not. Finally, your biography can be huge help on how you make it outstanding or not. Good luck and screen through more posts on this topic!"

I often search the name on facebook, look up the phone number. These things are not always reliable, but often times the phone number comes up with a matching name or I do find them on facebook. That being said, don't freak out if the number comes up under a different name, as I recently changed phone numbers and know someone else comes up under mine. I would use those more as a possible bonus comfort check than a definite red flag raiser. Some red flags I would note are if the number comes up as a texting app number or something strange. When it comes to in person interviews, you can ask for a public first meeting at Starbucks or something. If they want you to come to the house and you're comfortable with it after a phone interview, I always let my boyfriend know where I'll be, when I'll be there, and if I don't text him within an hour to just give me a call and check in."

I\u2019ve always provided my clients my background check via my local law enforcement agency without any issues.  I\u2019ve had my CNA license for over 25 years and I\u2019m a well seasoned caregiver in addition smart and grown enough to handle my own affairs.  I recently was informed that I needed to get my Care check and thought \u201cok let me check it out\u201d yes they ask for your #ssn and immediately I said no I\u2019m very skeptical with submitting my personal info over a website that may or may not be secure.  I talked it over with my husband and he convinced me that it was ok and I received the check.  I\u2019m not 100% ok with this and I\u2019m holding my breath at the moment..one of my concerns is that no where on this website does it list a contact number in case you need to discuss a issue with customer service/Care.com administrative assistance that I\u2019ve ran across.  And I have navigated all the pages...and I cannot even find anyway to send a email...or live chat and it seems to me if they advertise to be one of the worlds largest care community then that should be well established and in place on their website.   I actually went off the website and googled the contact info and got the number!!! But it is not listed on the website anywhere!  As far as the submitting our #ssn... I had a young lady on the discussion page telling us that it was absolutely secure! When in fact we know that nothing is absolute and I was amazed that there are individuals that believe it.  We are taking a chance to say the least..I love the Website and  it has given me the opportunity to work in my community for some great seniors for many years now.  Hope we don\u2019t wake up tomorrow and learn of a security breach!"

	"text": "I\u2019ve been wondering this because I\u2019ve had some very questionable & some really negative experiences that I feel other nannies should know about. Story time: I had a situation where I was working with a 1 year old who\u2019s mother seemed like she was trying a little too hard to be my friend. I went along with it but I discovered that she had a really bad attitude. a situation arose where the baby got sick and she asked me to not come that next day. I was thankful that she wanted to take care of him herself because I prefer not to care for sick children, to prevent getting other children I take care of sick. She called me and while we were talking I asked what the baby had. She got a terrible attitude with me saying how it wasn\u2019t my business and a lot of other things, I politely explained that I didn't mean any harm but I would like to know if he might still be contagious whenever she asked me to come back. Well, she went off. I never argue with stupid. As soon as I felt my blood begin to boil listening to her rant, I hung up. I calmed down and composed myself then I called back to tell her that it wasn\u2019t going to work out, we just weren\u2019t a good fit but she didn\u2019t answer. So i texted it. surely I wasnt going to show up to a confrontational, argumentative and hot tempered persons home after that and expect her to be civil with me. She retaliated by writing a negative review. A Totally false review by the way \ud83d\ude44 has anyone else had any experiences like this? Am I the only one who feels we should be able to leave THEM reviews also?!?! They want reviews, references, and a background check for us but I\u2019ve been in some situations where I felt like I wish I had more information on the parents. They are strangers to us as much as we are to them. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll never happen, just a little pondering that I thought i\u2019d share."

	"text": "Okay, Sheryl :) I have some answers for yoooouuuuu. Your biggest issue is that you are not vetted in any way shape or form. People are hiring a stranger offline so they need something to be able to trust that they as parents are making the right decision. You may have woooonderful experience, but they have no evidence from your profile and that's the only thing they are going to see at first. And actually your bio doesn't describe any previous childcare experience. There is just no evidence to say how in the world you would be with other folks children.\n\nNumber one:\nReviews and \"cared for\" number up\n\nNumber 2:\nBackground check\n\nNumber 3:\nBio needs to sell any childcare experience you have\n\nNumber 4:\nChange your profile pictures please-1st one should be \"professional\" headshot with just you, 2nd one-aaaawwwww cute doggy! :) But he is sadly irrelevant to this profile, particularly the way he is in the center of that picture. \n\nNumber 5:\nYour profile says full-time, but as you've stated you are looking for part-time so you need to change that, or else the folks looking for part-time help will have a hard time finding you. In addition your calendar is completely filled out so it DOES look like you are looking for full-time so definitely if you can fix that asap. :)\n\nNow that I am done with the things that are a work in progress:\n\nGreat job at filling out your calendar! :) Excellent for being CPR and First Aid Certified. 10+ years experience? Fantastic! Now I just need some evidence of what you did in those 10+ years to be reflected in your reviews and bio.\n\nSo we have some baby steps to conquer here. If you could start working on some of those things. Then feel free to come back to me if you'd like and I'd be ever so happy to see what the next steps should be. If you need help developing a more fleshed out bio, all I would need to know is what are some actual things that you have done in childcare and we can get cranking on a fantastic bio for you. :)\n\nHope that helps! Feel free to let me know if you have any further questions, Sheryl :)"

I would be happy to assist you today! \n\n&nbsp;We greatly appreciate your opinion, and are always working to make sure our members are having the best experience possible with the site. I do apologize if you found our safety screening disappointing. We created this feature based on feedback from members just like you, and we will make sure to pass your experience and suggestions on to our Product Management team for review. We are always grateful when our members let us know if something isn\u2019t working well, or when they have an idea of how something could work better!&nbsp;\n\nWe realize this new fee may mean that some caregivers will not be able to continue on Care.com, but we believe this is an essential step toward a safer platform with fully engaged care providers. We also believe that a Care.com basic membership offers the best value of any care platform, including access to the most jobs across the country, the ability to build trust with families with a background check badge, and the ability to keep 100 percent of all wages earned.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;Our commitment to innovation is reflected in the ongoing advancement of our safety tools and features to improve trust and connectivity on the platform.&nbsp; These include a new coronavirus-related self-reporting feature now available on your profile.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;Safety on all fronts remains critical to building trust between families looking for care and the caregiving workforce. When engaged workers are easier to find, matches happen more quickly.\n\n&nbsp;If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to let me know or you can visit our&nbsp;Help&nbsp;page.\n\nBest Wishes,\nJenny\nCare.com Member Care\n\nMy response...\n\nThis is literally a slap in the face. You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. This is a money scheme and nothing more. Because I can guarantee that NO Caregiver on the site asked to have a required $15 fee to KEEP their account. If you guys were ACTUALLY listening to your Caregivers, the ones who bring you more account holders, you would read TONS of stuff on the site, community forum, that everyone is appalled by this FORCED fee. What they ARE asking for, is MORE safety for themselves. Where are the background checks for the families we are applying to?? We have NO IDEA what we're getting ourselves into when going to meet a family. Some of your CAREGIVERS on the site have been treated very poorly by families on your site. But do you even care about them?! No, you care about charging someone who is trying to make money, a FORCED fee, JUST for them to keep their account active. Let's get something straight as well, I'm not against a background check. I am against a FORCED fee for one, when there is NO GUARANTEE that I will find a job, or that MY safety is JUST as important as the families we are applying to. If a family that I apply to wants me to get a background check, then I would gladly get one, have before. But to make it an annual fee to KEEP my account, is highway robbery.\n\nIf you TRULY cared about a safer platform, like you claim, you would require your families looking for help, to also get the SAME background check. And to say that you are trying to get a 'safer platform with fully engaged care providers', is so disrespectful. To say that someone isn't 'fully engaged' because they don't want to pay an annual fee, that is a money scheme, is beyond rude. Again we are the ones that pass the word of mouth to other people. And again you mention, 'Safety on all fronts remains critical to building trust between families looking for care and the caregiving workforce'. It's a farce. Because it's not safety on all fronts, because this is totally one sided. When you require families looking for help to get a background check, then it will be 'On all fronts'. Until then, tell it like it is...'We are now charging an annual fee for our BASIC membership.' Be upfront, honest, and EQUAL on all fronts, and you'll have more memberships, and people actually trusting you.\n\nI will not be paying the fee, and I will NOT be recommending Care.com to anyone else. Will be doing the exact opposite actually. I've had 3 jobs through the site, since 2013. I used to tell everyone to go to Care.com, families looking for help, and caregivers looking for work. No more.&nbsp;\n\nGod Bless and have a nice day.\nJanelle"

I do have a great profile that I have polished over the years, a great cover letter, and some great references with my profile here on Care.com.

	"text": "Hi Dailyn :)\n\nLove your smiling picture! So cute. However I do believe that that is your daughter, correct? People want to know that you have had experience with other people's children. It gives them more of a \"professional\" experienced vibe. So maybe want to change the first/main picture to a picture of just you in a \"professional\" waaaayyy(that's the only term I have for it right now, so someone help me out lol). \n\nNot sure what the accurate rate range is in your area(no need to specify location on this post)but, if I'm not mistaken $20-$40 is quite a large range. Do you work jobs in this complete range? If not, please narrow it down, I'm guessing to the low end. Some families just will skip over your profile if there's too much of a puzzle about your range. They like quick info and answers when scrolling through profiles.\n\nYou are bilingual. Heck yes! :) Awesome.\n\nPlease get CPR and First Aid Certified.\n\nThe last job on your history ended in 2016 and your \"cared for\" number says 0. Definitely need to build on that. Hopefully this feature is working better now and in that case you just definitely see if you can pick up a quick babysitting gig or two just to spike your numbers or get some GREAT reviews. As I think your goal is a \"part-time nanny gig\", right?\n\nWhat are you \"pursuing\" a college degree in?\n\nGreat job on beginning on reviews! :) I'd like more reviews that tell me what you actually did while on a job/gig. It doesn't seem like your reviews are from anyone you have actually worked for. Just personal references?\n\nYour availability calendar is not filled out at all. You should definitely try to put in it availability for the hours of the types of positions that you are looking for. Doesn't necessarily have to be your actual availability, especially if your ultimate goal is not babysitting gigs.\n\nWhen you receive messages, please respond to them within a few hours if possible. Want to get your response rate down below <1 day. It also helps you work towards carepro if you have a 75% response rate within 24 hours. \n\nTo get carepro you also would need 1 more review and a few other things which details of you can find on the website.\n\nIf possible definitely add a background check to your profile. They are good for a couple of months. And whenever you are actively, rigorously applying it would be great if you can go \"premium\".\n\nHope this helps! Feel free to let me know if you have any questions. :)"

Care is very straightforward about the fact that they are merely allowing people to connect. However, whenever I have complained about the behavior of a parent, they have revoked that person\u2019s membership. At the same time, they are like any business, they need to make money. They can\u2019t have us all on here for free. I have never paid for a background check on myself. I encourage the parents I interview with to do a background check on whomever they choose to hire. Yes, some of the people on here are dodgy, but everyone is an adult. If Care vetted everyone who posts an ad or published a nanny profile, they might as well shut the site down. You can answer all the ads you want, but some families are so picky, they will pass people over for silly reasons. I once interviewed with a family that had 38 responses to their ad. That is a lot of nannies to choose from! I think we probably outnumber the potential employers on this site. I have also seen nannies say they charge so much per child, etc. I don\u2019t know where these nannies supposedly making $60,000+ live, but it certainly isn\u2019t upstate NY."

Just remember you are a grown-up and if they ask you anything that makes you uncomfortable tell them you are uncomfortable With their line of questioning. Anything that is not specifically relevant to your experience caring for children and any criminal activities you may have ever been involved in, Is NOT OKAY. Ask the family who is paying you first if they wish you to know what the financial arrangements are that you have made with them, because it\u2019s not something the non custodial parent needs to know."

	"text": "Okay, Maribel. :) So I literally scrolled through your pictures and said out loud \"awwww, that's so nice.\" I love the little activity shots. Hooooowever, you do need to change your main profile picture. It's not what some folks would call \"professional\". A little too social media. You know? Not quite the right fit for the job hunt. Try something more straight on, possibly smiling. But it's a nice pic!\n\nWoooooooowwww. I LOVE the 8 reviews! That's stellar! Although it's technically 7 because somehow someone was able to post the same thing twice. Interesting.\n\nOkay. So the things that are working against you that may stop parents from messaging are that none of your reviews are actually like a first-hand account of a day of you coming to work for a family. Something like Maribel was great with my 3 kids ages blah blah blah. The played outside, rode bikes, did lunch, made some paper snowflakes...I think you get the idea. Parents want to be able to picture you in the role they are trying to fill in their house.\n\nOne year of experience is a start. Definitely want to make sure to keep updating that number every year. Above 5 will be a great place to land eventually.  I think some parents will shy away from just 1 unfortunately. WHICH only means that you have to have stellar reviews too prove that years mean NOTHING to you and you are AMAZING regardless.\n\nYou need to get CPR and First Aid certified and check those off on your profile.\n\nIt would most definitely help your situation to be background checked and to go premium. Anything to overcome that 1 year part and that  you do not hold a college degree. For some reason parent's love their caregivers to have college degrees. It's a thing they think makes you more qualified in their minds so that's something you have to make up for in other areas, unfortunately.\n\nI'm not sure what things you may be missing why you don't have a carepro badge yet. You definitely want to look into that and see if you can knock that out. If all else fails google carepro badge for the specific requirements.\n\nYour cared for number currently says 0. I've left some past specifics on this in some of my other evals so feel free to read those. But I always like it to not just say \"cared for 0 families\". So however you can get that done would be great.\n\nYour avg. response time is actually one of the best I have seen so far <3 hours. GREAT job!\n\nYour calendar needs to be filled out. If anything just to keep you higher in searches. But if you can fill it out with the ideal hours that you are looking for in a full-time job that would definitely help families when they are scrolling through TONS of profiles. If they have no idea what your actual availability is they may just skip over you.\n\nUnder your \"qualifications, certifications and credentials,\" I'd love for you to find a different way to say \"work in daycare\" or actually you can delete that and just explain your daycare work up above in your bio. That would be better. Which now I see it's already there so just capitalize on your daycare experience and the things that you do there.\n\nAnd your bio luckily has A LOT of room still left in it to add things. You are missing basically all the periods at the ends of your sentences and the sentences have different types of errors. Please have someone help you to redo your bio. It's actually a significant problem right now, unfortunately. But COMPLETELY fixable. :) The ladies on the discussion board are always happy to jump in and help you fix some drafts of your bio. Just create a post with it and explain what you need help with.\n\nThink I covered it all. Let me know if you have any other questions, Maribel. :)"

My daughter had a similar situation where a mom had her meet her 2 kids at a park for an interview, then had her follow the family back to their home for a \"trial\" run playdate of sorts. To make a VERY long story short, it ended up that BOTH children had severe sensory integration issues &amp; the son was so bad at times that the mom instructed my daughter to lock the son in a room and for she and the daughter to find a \"safe spot\" until the son calmed down! To make matters worse, once my daughter realized that the ad was NOT AT ALL for severely disabled kids and that she did not feel equipped to handle their family needs, the mother bashed my daughter on Care.com, giving her the same response as you received AND leaving a 1 Star review about what a terrible person she is, etc. WHERE IS PROTECTION FOR THE EMPLOYEE here? Care-givers have to supply often i.d., background checks &amp; references and the employers are never SCREENED by Care.com people! \nYou did NOTHING WRONG! Some people should just never have kids nor get married!"

	"text": "To answer your question about the background check, yes, you need a social security number to get a background check. It\u2019s how they confirm they are checking the right person. I\u2019ve gone through many background checks for various jobs/internships and they always ask for a social security number. The background check companies use secure sites so that your information is safe. I\u2019m extremely cautious about sharing really personal information, and will only do it on secure sites or in person. Never email a social security number. \nYou don\u2019t pay monthly for background checks. You can pay monthly for a premium membership, but that is not required. I\u2019ll throw out there that I got a really good job without a premium membership. You can choose to pay for your own background and motor vehicle check, but that is also not required. I would put in my applications that I was willing to undergo any checks they wished. That way it showed I was serious and willing, but then they paid for it. \nAs far as being nervous of paying things online, the only advice I can give you there is to religiously monitor your bank accounts. If something doesn\u2019t seem right, contact your bank. I pay all of my bills online and honestly trust it way more than pay by mail. You can be smart about it. \nGood luck and I hope this helps!"

A play by play of your intentions and then allowing the parent to give you feed back before it happens 1) allows clear communication and trust, 2) opens the floor to let the parent tell you of any issues they may have with any activities (some are just silly and get moved past quickly) and 3) this also shows you care enough to work with their children, and show you care for the parents feelings too by including them. \n\nTalk about age appropriate activities or stages you've recently read about (it's good for parents to see you still care even off the clock) \n\nI agree with the person who commented before me about the background check, exchanging license info and them speaking to your references. Also talk about your CRP qualifications and any medical training you have, parents need to know you're prepared and capable. Even if you already know, ask the parents for a refresher on their med kid and where all emergency info is. (They'll feel better knowing you want to be and stay prepared) \n\nAll of this helps with establishing trust, but the best advice anyone can give you is to simply keep communication open and frequent. \n\nGood luck! \n\n-Ash"

The Red Cross offers certifications for Adult/Child/Infant CPR/AED/First Aid.  The cost is reasonable, completed in a day and is good for two years.  CA CNA course/certification is also reasonably priced and can be completed in a very short time, it is also good for two years.  A Level One background check cost less then $25, a Level 2 is a little more.  If you decide to become a CNA., CA requires background and fingerprints.  The agency/school where you get the CNA training from will help you w/that .  Families who have hired me through this site have purchase the background check, which means they pay for it and you can see the information that they see.  All of these certifications add to your net worth and help validate why you are asking the per hour/pay rate."

I do have cpr, a reliable car and 4 reviews with 5* from friends.  I have been on care for 4 weeks and have been hired by 5 families and I have 2 waiting to be fit into my schedule for June.  I am in the top 5% this week!  I end my profile with, I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.  I end messages with questions, to get them to respond until they ask for an interview.  If they don't ask, I say, why don't we meet and discuss our schedules?  That works in my favor most of the time!  I have gotten every job I have interviewed for except twice, where they have misled me about the hours or days and the one about the days has texted me back to ask if I was available for my requested days, in June, great!!  I am an old lady LOL but I have a lot of energy and love to talk, especially about how important the safety of their child is and how much fun I like to have with children, outside and inside with no tv.  \n\nI have no 'child education' background and I am truthful about any and all questions they ask.  Don't let a white lie come back and bite ya!  I am very forthright about my hourly rate, which is about $2 higher than what care says is 'normal' for my area.  I tell them I take minimum 6 hours and if my car is used for child, 50cents a mile on top of hourly pay.  My first priority is the child, not cleaning, laundry, etc.  If I have time, I can help out with it.  Apparently it pays off to know your worth and stick to it.  \n\nThe kiddos love me, so far so good ;) most of my kiddos are under 1 year, but I do have a 2 yr old and 2 families w/4 children ages 3,6,12,15 and 2,5,9,13.  These are drop offs and pick ups and some date nights/overnights.  Overnights are min $200.  \n\nOne of my first families paid for a background check, I paid for premium and a dmv check was included.  The criminal and background check can be shared with other families,  let them know!! just download it and send it to them before your interview. Please check your spelling and grammar when messaging, even on your phone ;)  Have a friend or someone who can write, help you with your profile if you are not getting any responses.  Most of my responses have come from my profile, not by applying to a job, go figure! Good luck!!"

I invest in supplies ( mainly for crafts) and books to stay current on infant/toddler care as it relates to sleep habits etc. I also bring a lot to the table as it relates to meeting appropriate milestones. So, although my area is low, I charge considerably more due to my experience and education. I do not do laundry nor drive children around at that rate. Nor do I offer it at an additional fee. I simply will not do it! I offer quality care and never at a discounted rate. My expenses are never lowered based on negotiation so why should my services be offered for pennies?

	"text": "A little more about this - I have 15 years of experience, 4 of those being with special needs children, I subscribed and paid to communicate with parents, and I paid for a background check. This has been over a 6 month span. Every family who has gotten back to me, either fails to follow up or they want to pay $10/hour for two kids, plus transportation, plus cleaning, plus homework. I don\u2019t mind doing all of that, but I was making $30/hour doing it for a different family and $20/hour for one child, same duties. The first family I didn\u2019t find on here. I worked in a summer camp and they found me, but their kids are 16 and 14 now so they don\u2019t need me and the other family\u2019s hours unfortunately no longer work with my own children\u2019s school drop off and my husband\u2019s work schedule. I would really like to stay with them, but they need VERY early morning care and this used to work great for me, as my husband used to work nights and was able to take our kids to school, but he\u2019s working early mornings now, and finding someone to work the hours the family needs (5:45 am and I have to leave my house at 5:30) has proven somewhat impossible.\n\nAnyway, after months and months of looking on here, and finding many families whose hours work with mine, I have had no luck. I went on another site similar to this and found 2 jobs within 2 months - one pet sitting 4 afternoons per week and another working with a teen with special needs 3 evenings per week. I have seen countless posts on here about not being able to find work and I\u2019m stating this because I\u2019ve also seen countless replies with advice. But here\u2019s my advice: stop looking on here. You\u2019re not doing anything wrong. It\u2019s the people this site is attracting. This site isn\u2019t what it was 2 years ago, when I began working for the family that needs the early mornings. There are serious employers and serious nannies who aren\u2019t accepting minimum wage for the duties I named above (which undercuts our wages) elsewhere and I advise anyone experiencing these difficulties to look elsewhere."

Care can be famous in some areas but not in others and again, you are competing with other candidates as well and parents will look at your education, experiences, certifications, your age, distance from them and much more. Have an outstanding biography with proper syntax, punctuation... If you can afford a premium, I suggest you upgrade for a 1-3month trial. It comes with a free Motor vehicle record check, you can reply to any parents back and forth, you will get a daily morning alerts to apply for jobs ahead of non premium members, you can look at your stats to see if parents are viewing your profile and you will also appear on the top search list from parents. If you can get 3 reviews from the people you worked with, respond to all of your messages within 24hrs, add a debit card on file with the motor vehicle record badge on file, you will get the CAREPRO status which can boost you up more. But please keep in mind that none of these will guarantee you a job especially if jobs are rare in your area but it\u2019s best to always have all advantages because we never know. The premium did help me compared to when I didn\u2019t have it. I got more booking, interview requests and messages. Yes some people can still get a job without it but it\u2019s different for everyone depending of some factors i mentioned above. Keep on applying and be patient.\nAlso, apply to other websites as well. Some of them don\u2019t require a monthly premium. Good luck!"

It's something like $60 for 6 months which ends up being $10 a month. Much better arrest him for your buck. \nIt's important to invest if you're serious about a nanny career or other job titles you're interested in. It's also important to purchase a criminal background check/DMV record and obtain reviews from people you've helped and keep your response rate up. \nThere's a lot of maintenance to do however very worth it if this is your career. \nLastly all of this investment leads to more access and landing more jobs. Try to become Care Pro which puts you in top percentages when families are looking for care. You will benefit from being say in the top 10 percentile of caregivers in your area. Families will see your profile present. \nAbout the bio try to give the important key points that they would be interested in like CPR certified, classes you've taken in college that qualify you, being flexible with a schedule and much more. \nHope this helps and best of luck in finding a great family!\nLisa S."

However, I suggest you get the premium since you are new so that you can appear hire on the search list from parents. It\u2019s only $20/month or $50 for 6 months. It comes with a free motor vehicle record (MVR) check in case you don\u2019t want to just pay the background check alone( $33). You only need either the MVR or the background if you can\u2019t afford both and the premium.\nRemember that you are competing with highly qualified candidates as well. Get 3 reviews too and add a debit card on file. Check some previous posts. Keep on applying even if it\u2019s 50 jobs daily. Good luck!"

Well now I\u2019m still only 20, but my son is over a year old, I own my own house, I have my own car, and Im BLS certified (a step up from CPR). So I decided why not give it a try again? So I did and I ordered a background check. Well I got married almost a year ago. The profile still has my maiden name, so I tried to call the customer service, but it said it was after business hours. Anyways I got a notification saying there was a problem with my background check and I wouldn\u2019t be charged. Well I was already charged and I don\u2019t know how to deal with the b.c. problem. I put my new name and maiden name on the b.c. Anyone have any ideas how to fix this?"

I found my current job as live-in caretaker position through Craigslist.For the most part,it has worked out alright with the exception being when I was physically assaulted by one of client's friends.Lixin,with so many people out of work,measured in the tens of millions,it's important to conduct your job search with faith and positive mindset.This is what is going to keep you going when things get rough and start feeling depressed and maybe doubting yourself.I'll mention the following again:Check out the following websites:Care.com,Craigslist,Indeed.com and it's sister site,Simplyhired.com.Also,apply at local domestic worker/nanny agencies which can definitely be found on indeed.com.To put the odds in my favor,I recently did 3 things on care.com.Signed up for criminal background check,50 dollars,Signed up for Premium membership,45 dollars with promo code and includes free MVR and paid 15 dollars for Carecheck.Also,I advertise that I'm physically fit for heavy lifting which I am.Lixin,I just found out 2 days ago that care.com is offering free HHA course.Can't beat that!!! Also,make sure to visit these jobsites everday and different hours but dont get obsessive about it either! Also,you should go out of your way to get CPR card online or at a local business that offers these classes.Cost will be 20 to 55 dollars,no fooling.Also,if your flexible,apply for different job titles:Nanny,Senior Caretaker or even Housekeepers.Ive seen ads looking for female housekeepers/Cooks that pay well! Also,it seems more retail places are hiring,too.That's all I 've got right now.Good luck and stay strong."

So when you apply to a job tell them in your note you have your own background checks .

	"text": "Oh! You're a teen? :) Well, way to go on taking the initiative to read up on things on the discussion board. You've discovered it a lot earlier than I did. lol And you've actually been hired off care already? I see you have some reviews. Definitely want to make sure each job you DO end up getting even if it is not from care, you ask those folks to leave you a review. And do a STELLAR job to guarantee that it is 5 star. I wouldn't necessarily say 5-star when you ask. lol Might be a bit too forward. But you need to be collecting 5 star reviews to gain back that half a star so go above and beyond for every gig you get including planning/bringing activities, being EARLY not just on-time etc.\n\nGoing premium is always a plus. It lets you see who has actually looked at your profile if you go to your \"stats\". If there's any way to bring your avg. response rate down to below the \"<1 day\" to like \"<2-4 hours\" that would be great too. I'm guessing you are restricted with a school schedule though as a teen.\n\nSo you definitely wouldn't be full-time if you are in school too...although I see it is online school so not sure how that works with your schedule. An after school position would be part-time and babysitting would be babysitting. If you can change your profile from \"full-time\" to one of those options that would be helpful because people may think you only accept full-time and a lot of folks actually aren't going to hire a teen full-time, unfortunately. If you are looking for full-time your calendar does not reflect tat at all. But great job at actually putting something IN your calendar. :) Nice.\n\nIiiiii personally like your profile picture as a picture. But as your profile pic for care you should probably change it to something more \"professional\". A nice headshot facing straight on possibly with a nice smile. As a teen you have a lot more age bias to combat so you definitely want to up the \"pro\" vibe wherever you can.\n\nAlso, a full-time job IF that is actually what you are looking for is probably going to take more lengthy reviews. It is a long term commitment for parents and they'd like as much reference feedback as possible to make sure they are making the best long-term selection as possible.\n\nYou definitely want to get CPR and First Aid Certified. As a teen, who doesn't get a background check, the CPR is one more thing that gives you more credibility that the parents can \"trust\" you with their children.\n\nIf possible you also want to get your \"cared for\" number above 0. To me, it just sounds bad when someone reads \"cared for 0 families\". It's right on the top of the profile. So even if you can just get 1 person to mark you as hired that would be an improvement. Even if you just ask someone you know who you have cared for their kids in the past who is willing to create an account(shouldn't take that long) to mark you(also hopefully this feature is working on the website right now). If you have problems with that contact careteam@care.com\n\n\nYour bio has some grammatical and punctuation errors in it so definitely get someone to proofread. The ladies of the discussion board are always happy to jump in and help if you create a posting asking for help with your drafts. BUT I love that you put what ages of children you have experience with. That's awesome!\n\nI think that's it! Let me know if you have any more questions, Cynthia. :)"

What am saying is you have to invest a little plus you don't have to upgrade if parents have premium? Just give it time. Some come here with the mentality that it's easy money. It's better to start looking for other sources, like Facebook and NextDoor. There is ways but constantly posting about needing to upgrade won't land you a job. Plus people post tips on better bios, better applications, certifications. Learn from people that have more experience and give it time. Then you can decide if this website is for you rather then getting offended."

There is a very long thread lurking around about a family who spent $300 on some kind of tickets. And lost that money due to last minute cancellation by caregiver. So many running to the defense of the family (mother) who was less than happy about \u201closing \u201c $300.....that is no different than a family looking for a caregiver they trust with their child/children. It\u2019s actually less important in the grand scheme of things. I just had a new background check and MVR done, with tax it came to $42.12 and is good for 6 months. That\u2019s $7.02 per month, in my opinion. But as I said everyone has an opinion and is entitled to have it. We don\u2019t have to agree."

If you don\u2019t want to upgrade you can leave your email for them to contact you that way. Normally if I really want a job I will pay for a month and have always gotten a job while using premium.

Care charges a premium of $20/mo or $50/6mo or a yearly fee which depends on you and you can stop it at anytime (downgrade). A premium doesn\u2019t guarantee a job because you need to actively be on the website, apply for jobs (at least 20 jobs in a day) and parents look at your education, certifications, age, experiences, location and much more. Some areas are highly competitive and you are competing with highly qualified candidates as well. These are the things you need to keep in mind. The premium will give you a free motor vehicle record check which can be a substitute for a background check (if you can\u2019t afford that), appear higher on the search list from parents, be able to message them back and forth and apply to jobs ahead of those that don\u2019t have the membership.\nUnfortunately, care won\u2019t reimburse you your $$$$.

Everyone now realizes what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 caregiving is critical to families and the services you provide are an essential part of our economy.\n\nRecently, we decided to increase our level of screening for caregivers to include a background check, called a CareCheck. This safety screening is an important step in our commitment to creating a safer Care.com community. With CareCheck, families will have a safer foundation to evaluate caregivers, and caregivers will be able to find jobs more quickly to provide essential care.\n\nAs a result, in order to participate on our platform, all caregivers will be charged a $14.99 fee, which will automatically renew annually. By getting a CareCheck, you'll not only show families you're serious about safety, but you'll continue to have access to all of the same great benefits you enjoy now as a Care.com member.\n\nWe hope you\u2019ll get a CareCheck and continue using Care.com to find high-quality, well-paying jobs. On behalf of everyone at Care.com, thank you for being an important part of our caregiving community.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nTim Allen\nCEO, Care.com"

I had it for a few months actually but begin to realize I think the reason I wasn\u2019t getting any clients is because I didn\u2019t do a background check or ask for reviews! I know it says it will higher the chances of getting hired if I do so. My reviews came in after a day, now waiting for my background check. Also having to pay to have this website is unfair, especially when no one replies. I heard it takes a while but I also hear it\u2019s worth the money after you start getting clients. This is the reason I\u2019m still with In Home Supportive Services, besides the fact that I love my clients I am with now....but I\u2019m just slowly waiting... is there a way you can privately message on here or look up other profiles who are also searching for a job?"

	"text": "To start a Family Day Care, \nFirst, you need to be certified by the city or town you plan to have a Family Day Care.  It is 12 weeks class.  You may also include to take the class that is offered by the DSS.  I think DSS has a new name now.   There are children who you may babysit that came from a dysfunctional family and you need to be certified by the DSS also.   But you do not that certification right away.  The most important is that you call the city Hall that you would want to open a Family Day Care at your home.  To start a Day Care for the first time, there are very important things for you to know in order to get approved and certified by the city or town where you are conducting a Family Day Care.  After you received all the papaerworks and filled them up it takes 12 weeks to get it approved.   The city assigned someone to go to your home and check everything inside your house.   They do a criminal background check on you and everyone who live in your house.   Drinking and smoking are not allowed while the kids are in your care.   Also, they check the condition of the house and second floor is not allowed.  Only first floor is allowed to conduct a Family Day Care.  If you live on the first floor and the building has other floors and there are people who live their that has criminal background the city will not approve your application.  If everything is okay with them between the house  condition and also must have a backyard for the kids to play because they only allow 6 children including your own child or children.  It takes 12 weeks to get the approval by the city.   You also have to call the IRS to get EIN number if you plan to hire someone to help you.  If not because you are self employed you may use your Social Security for now until at the end of the year you pay what is due to the government.  After everything is dais and done then  you start advertise to every parent that you are conducting a Family Day Care.  I think I covered everything.  \n\nVictoriana M"

After signing up they help you become a care pro and tell you what you need to do to become that. Simply fix up your bio, get 3 reviews, a background check through the website,  ( I did motor vehicle only because I already have a background check from working at a daycare) and a few other things. It does make a difference because you are set apart from other with this badge and once I got it I did see families message me that I never applied to. \n\nYour bio and application are your main factors. If you have a strong, well written bio and application you\u2019re golden. If you\u2019d like you can send us what your bio and application say on here and ask for advice on how to make it look nicer. Those two things are the first thing that parents see about you. It needs to be detailed but simple explaining your strengths and thanking them for reading it. After the application I always send a I hope to hear back from you soon text that says I\u2019d love to ask you a few questions about the position and answer any that you may have for me. It makes conversation. Sometimes you won\u2019t get a response, but sometimes you will. I get about 2 different family responses a day. You need to stay home persistent, but kind and mindful that they\u2019re busy parents. Sometimes they don\u2019t respond right away or simply they don\u2019t have premium and can\u2019t see your full application until two weeks later and they don\u2019t wanna pay for premium because they still have a few months before needing a nanny. That\u2019s what happened with the family I\u2019m gonna nanny for. She responded two weeks after I sent my application because she could only see bits of it and each day it would reveal a little more, but wouldn\u2019t let her respond back until 2 weeks later. Patience is needed to find a job on here, but I prefer it over the other nanny sites."

I spent a year and a half working at a crisis house for adults with severe behaviors, followed by some time working at a school.

I have 9 years of experience working with children; my youngest charge was 8 weeks and the oldest was 12 years, although the bulk of my experience is with the ages 1-4. I enjoy arts and crafts and I'm a huge bookworm.  I'm happy to answer any other questions you have and would love to meet you!\n\nMy message is pretty long, but my recommendations for you are:\n1.

I think that if you live in an urban area like NYC, or California, the best website is UrbanSitter. No membership fees for sitters, you just pay for the background check which is $17.95/year and if you send them a copy of your CPR, you get a badge for it. You can enhance your own profile by using the website (features are missing in the app) and fill out all sessions of the app and it\u2019s very well structured and easy to manage compared to Care.\nSittercity has a low rate offers from parents and I still never had a booking from anybody on it. I am new to Bambino and can\u2019t say much about that.\nWhichever you use, always get a background check, get couple reviews from people you know so that you can start from there and read the faqs.

I truly am. \n\nWhen I say times have changed (and I have no idea how old you are) .....I guess I was trying to say people in general have changed and not for the better. And I\u2019m almost positive that I\u2019m going to get slammed for what I\u2019m going to say. People are more tolerant of things, or they just ignore them because they don\u2019t want to get \u201cinvolved\u201d.  I\u2019m throwing some things out there as \u201cfor instance\u201d....used to be that marijuana was illegal, but now it\u2019s \u201clegal\u201d in some states? Really, what\u2019s changed there? The tolerance of people, jails are crowded-can\u2019t send everyone to jail that has a \u201clittle bit of weed on them\u201d. Oh, yes you can. Used abandoned buildings, airfields, put them in tents.....use the sheriff in Maricopa County, Arizona as the standard. Some of the stuff that used to get a person thrown in jail for years on the first offense....is now three strikes and you\u2019re out. Really, again tolerance, ignoring situations, thinking people will learn their lesson. Nope, not as far as I\u2019m concerned. Let\u2019s rehabilitate these people, nope put them away for their sentence.\n\nI will stop there because I really got in my soapbox and probably had a couple of pages written. No sense in doing that. Bottom line for ME, it doesn\u2019t have to apply to anyone else......is that if my years of experience, my 5 star reviews, my glowing reference letters and my spotless background check and Motor Vehicle Records check isn\u2019t enough.....then I do want or need to work for someone who wants to use cameras. Yes, that is their choice/option and right to do so\u2014which I completely agree, but it is also my right choice/option and right not to be monitored if I do not agree with it.  These are my thoughts and opinions......and no one, absolutely no one, has to agree with me or even like what I said. It is what it is."

	"text": "Hi Karen,\n\nThe argument that families are at the mercy of their nannies is one-sided because nannies are equally at the mercy of their employers. There are numerous cases (nationally and globally) of nannies being abused by their employers... this includes physical abuse, financial abuse (e.g. withholding or skimming pay) and so on. It just happens that the reverse i.e. cases of nannies abusing children gets more media attention. \n\nNext, if googling a parent's name should be sufficient for nannies, shouldn't that be sufficient for families as well? Of course not. Walking into a strangers home is not easy, the same goes for letting a stranger into your home. Both carries risks. However, families have an advantage here since they typically obtain a wealth of information from and about their caregivers prior to hiring them. For example, references, SSN, criminal background check, motor vehicle check, reviews and (or) letters of recommendation, etc. Caregivers don't have that. So, I don't see what's so dramatic about a nanny asking for that little in return. Families are not the only ones with concerns for their privacy, wellbeing and safety- nannies need and deserve the same.\n\n If we are to compare what Victoria wrote to working in a company, I would say that those who work in companies and similar capacities have more information at their fingertips than nannies/caregivers. First, it's more likely than not that one can find information about a company on various outlets- Glassdoor, Social Media/Network, LinkedIn,  Google and so on. Thus, making it easier to find or even talk to former and (or) current employees of a company without asking the employer. Secondly, some companies facilitate correspondence between prospective employees and those in their alumni network. Childcare professionals namely those that work in private households don't have that privilege. \n\nAs for where are \"young people are getting this idea of asking for references from\"- that's assuming it's only young people who ask for that- I reckon it has to do with the fact that the industry and society at large is ever evolving. Think about it, there were things nannies, teachers, parents and co could do back then that they can't do today e.g. being allowed to spank a child. It was a norm then but a crime today. So, although this idea might seem shocking to some people today, it could very well be the norm tomorrow \ud83d\ude0a\n\nBest,\nUchechukwu"

My name is Shelby and I am currently a pharmacy student at _. I noticed you are looking for a summer babysitter. Here is a little bit more about me:\n\nI have been a babysitter ever since I was in middle school when I would babysit the younger kids of family friends. I have no problem with cooking, cleaning, laundry, or coming up with entertaining and educational activities. I am also CPR/first aid certified and I do have my own car. Included is access to my vehicle background check.\n\nI love going on hikes with my dog and swimming in Lake Michigan. I have experience tutoring kids in math, science, and Spanish. I have taken courses in Spanish, American Sign Language, chemistry, biology, and math through calculus. I also love anything that has to do with art: crafting, drama, dance, music, you name it. I have 15 years of dance experience and 7 years of theater experience. In the summers of 2013 and 2014, I was an intern with _ Civic Theater where I would assist with their child theater program, so I also know how to teach a large group of kids.\n\nMy availability: As of right now I have completely open availability for this summer starting June 21.\n\nIf you have any questions for me please let me know. Your family sounds awesome and I would love the chance to work with you, even if it's just as a date night sitter!\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon!"

	"text": "I have been a part of Care.com for about 5-6 years now. I imagined it would be something I could genuinely use as a side gig while I went to school and started my career as a teacher. I started my account in LA where I am originally from and was able to land a 3-week long gig the summer after my freshman year of college. When I was living in the Bay Area while I went to school, I occasionally applied to jobs. In the four years I was in college I did not land one babysitting job on Care and due to the fact that I support myself 100% in one of the most expensive cities in the world, I cannot afford a background check and so on and so forth on Care. Point being, I have landed one Care.com gig in the 5-6 years that I have been on here. I have applied to hundreds of postings and have been left on read or overlooked because of my lack of Care \"certification\". \n\nIt absolutely saddens me that I, an elementary school teacher who has built a career around helping children grow their minds cannot land a babysitting job. Now I genuinely believe I am more than capable of taking on a job as I work with school aged children every day, but I can't help but wonder if parents are looking for someone who has less going on in their lives to take care of their children, or looks a certain way, or can spend money on all of the premium fees on here. \n\nEither way, Care.com has done more to make me feel worse about myself than help me land jobs. If you are struggling with the same, stay positive and look for different ways to help yourself in this economy."

I think it\u2019s fine for long term commitment jobs because yes parents can take the time and money to run the check. But as far as babysitting/occasional care, parents aren\u2019t necessarily going to invest all of that into it. Optimally, if you can afford it the answer is to ALWAYS have a background check readily on file, as you just never know which parents will be cool with it or not and ultimately it IS one of the criteria parents can narrow down their search by so they just might NEVER see your profile if they do that. Hope that helps. :)"

I told him how dishonest this was and how disgruntled I was about it, and they wouldn't give me a partial refund for my paid up service through September even though purchased in March ( 2020) and we couldn't work , due to Covid, so that's two extra months they benefited  from but it made no difference.... They are bent of achieving their goal and care less of us. is my assumption... Bye ladies, its been real!  Enough said."

The CareCheck is Care's way of making sure you are who you say you are, you can work legally in the U.S, and you do not have a criminal record. The CareCheck will only show up as a badge on your profile. You will not be able to share it with your employers. Care will send you an email when you need to do this. \nIf you're referring to the free MVR (Motor Vehicle Record) background check, that is free with the purchase of the premium membership. \nI never pay for my background checks. I usually let the prospective employer request a background check through Care. That way it's at their expense, not mine. \nI hope this wasn't too confusing. It's still early for me. \ud83d\ude02 Good luck in your search. \ud83d\ude0a KK"

It is mandatory at this point because they need to just verify that people are who they say they are so they can reassure parents that you\u2019re for real. Do not pay for the background checks yourself. If a family is interested in hiring you they can do the background check and pay for it themselves. The background check is only good for six months anyhow and parents will generally want to do their own who really care about having one. The Parents can just request a background check from care.com, then care.com will send you a message asking permission to run your background check for them. If you get a request for a background check from someone you have not been communicating with at all, do not approve it."

If you need tips feel free to ask.) The evaluations are just my personal opinion based on feedback from hundreds of care.com families on what they are looking for in candidates/profiles.\n\nJust because someone has experience and is a nice person doesn\u2019t mean that they are guaranteed an offer from care.com families.

If they want you to get a background check locally instead of through care.com, you can go to your sheriffs office and give them your personal information and they will print out a report for you. It will just take them a few days.  Meanwhile with your name and drivers license and phone number they should be able to run a background check on you anyhow that will identify you. Remember, you want to be sure that you are a good fit with the family, not just that they think you\u2019re OK. If there seems to be something about their home or lifestyle that you know is going to make you very uncomfortable, tell them you don\u2019t think it will be a good fit if they do want to hire you. \n\nExamples: If you\u2019re a \u201cclean freak\u201d and there\u2019s a dirty cat box in the living room and cats eating and lounging on the kitchen counters, you\u2019ll probably end up unhappy. If you\u2019re into Wicca or nature worship, seeing indications that they are devout Christians or Jews, may end up causing you uneasiness or difficulties in the relationship. \n\nLong term Nanny jobs are almost like marrying in to a family if you\u2019ll be working in their home and taking children to events the parents arranged and approved of."

If that makes them uneasy in any way, they will more than likely back off. If they are on the up & up, this won\u2019t phase them, because you have already told them your age they will totally understand your mother coming to the initial meeting. Discuss it with your mother, see how she feels. And if between the two of you, you decide to interview with this family.....make sure your mother goes with you. That way she can meet them and a mother\u2019s instinct is probably better than any background check you could run on them!! Best of luck to you."

In order to stand out on Care.com seek for people to post positive reviews on your profile. A background check on your profile will be a plus. Also make sure that you log in often so people can see your profile in the first or second page. Most people that is seeking for services don't like to look for long, so they aren't going to look at the 20 pages of housecleaners in your area. Good Luck!"

Reviews will give them a sneak peek at your character, how well you work with children, and your work ethic. After I had reviews posted on my profile, families contacted me. I never applied to the current family I'm working for. They reached out to me and we ended up being a match made in heaven. \ud83d\ude0a Purchase the premium membership if you can. It's not necessary, but if you do, you will be notified of jobs in your area, remain higher in the search results, and be able to communicate with all of the families you've applied to, instead of only the families who have the premium membership. Having a background check on file is good, but it's not necessary, because a prospective employer can request a background check from you and they can purchase it through Care. Good luck!"

	"text": "Hey everyone, I originally got on this site back in 2011, and I ONLY paid for a membership for 1 month., and have NEVER paid SINCE.\n I immediately found a job that lasted three and a half years, until my client had to go into a Nursing Home because she needed 24-hour care and her daughter decided that was the best way to handle it. \n\nBut in the last 4 yrs I've had a couple of jobs (I have TWO 5-star reviews) and have been CONTACTED 8 times by people LOOKING for a  SENIOR Caregiver for their loved ones, AND, 3 people have CONTACTED ME for Childcare. \n\nI'm on CARE CHAT and it's totally FREE. \nHow it works is, after you sign up for it, employers/ families that have a paid membership can CONTACT YOU ANONYMOUSLY through this site, and then you can respond to them ANONYMOUSLY.  (and I THINK that if YOU are a paid member, and the clients are NOT, that YOU can CONTACT THEM-- because WHOEVER is the PAID member, has to INITIATE  THE COMMUNICATION).  \n\nAlso, when you sign up on Care Chat, you will have to choose a SPECIFIC Symbol so that you will know when you are being notified through the Care Chat option. \nThen you can choose to CALL them, or text them, but EITHER  WAY, it is done ANONYMOUSLY (& the phone # option will be a long distance #, but you will ALWAYS see the symbol you chose to CONFIRM that it is ANONYMOUS).\n\nBUT, if THEY have a paid membership, THEY can contact YOU, WITHOUT going through the ANONYMOUS/Care Chat option, so BE CAREFUL!!!!\n\nAnd in the past, when people have CONTACTED ME to OFFER me a job position, and they have INCLUDED THEIR personal  email, or THEIR personal phone number (NOT thru the Care Chat option),  Care.com will IMMEDIATELY send me a text and tell me that they RECOMMEND that I do NOT respond to them through any kind of PERSONAL CONTACTS until after I've had a chance to communicate with them ANONYMOUSLY thru CARE CHAT, and THEN once I am CONFIDENT that they are SAFE, and ONLY THEN should you arrange an initial meeting in a PUBLIC PLACE (for SAFETY REASONS). \nAnd that's because your IDENTITY is PROTECTED THROUGH THIS SITE, but once you give them any PERSONAL info, you are VULNERABLE, especially to SCAMMERS!!!\n\n....And just to let you know, if you DO PAY for a membership, I recommend that you NOT pay for MORE than ONE month AT A TIME. Because, if you find a job within that paid membership, and you try to put your membership on HOLD, they will NOT do it, and you will still be charged IN FULL for what you've already paid for. \n\nI have not worked for a couple of years since I got injured in an accident, but I've kept my profile open. \nAnd I got an email from Care.com recently that I needed to fill out the info for a Background Check, or I would have to start a brand new profile.\nI did it, and there was NO COST involved! \n\nI recommend you take advantage of that, because most families aren't going to want you in their house WITHOUT a Background Check, much less, trust you with their loved ones. \n\nAnd I highly recommend that if you have QUESTIONS, to email Care.com, and although it may take them a day or two to get back to you, they WILL RESPOND.\n\nAlso, if you email them and ASK them to give you a phone number to contact them DIRECTLY, you will have to listen to a lot of voice recorded messages about how to go to different WEBSITES for your answers.....HOWEVER, if you call THAT number and use the PROMPT for a CLIENT LOOKING  FOR a CAREGIVER,  they will ANSWER, or get back to you immediately if you leave a message and tell them that you are looking for a CAREGIVER.  \n\nGood luck to all of you! Just be careful and protect yourself, because SCAMMERS are EVERYWHERE,  and ALL THEY NEED is your phone number, (and ESPECIALLY your email) to STEAL YOUR IDENTITY. \n\nPROTECT YOURSELF, and ONLY communicate through CARE CHAT on this site...NEVER, EVER respond to a job post that has requested that you send them YOUR PERSONAL email, or call them directly through THEIR personal number!!! \n\nAnd I also, I suggest that if you see a post that has THEIR personal phone number, or THEIR personal email included, that you REPORT THEM, then Care.com will DELETE THEIR post!!! \n\nGood luck everyone!!!  Please PROTECT  yourselves and stay SAFE!!!  \ud83d\ude0a"

Your chances of getting a job increase if you are flexible with your starting pay rate and hours.\n\nI have a few suggestions that work for me. \n\n1) when applying for a job, do NOT use a canned response that you save over and over for every application. Personalize your letter to include details they mention in their ad. Demonstrate that you took the time to read and pay attention and you are genuinely interested.\n\n3) pay for the DMV check, the background check, and contact your local fire department about CPR class and pay for that too (usually about $50).\n\n4) Make sure you mention that not only do you have s positive review from your current family, but that they are willing to talk to new families on the phone. I\u2019m very lucky\u2014 my current employer has talked to many potential new employers for me. It\u2019s made a huge difference.\n\n4) post several photos of yourself, including one of you with kids you\u2019ve worked with (get employer\u2019s permission) and make a video.\n\n5) last but definitely not least, write a profile/bio that talks about what you live about being a nanny and what you are passionate about.

But now since it\u2019s summer and all the other college students are on break- the applicant numbers on each post have tripled the amount of people who are applying to jobs. \nAnd also with the background checks- with the family I am currently with paid to have a background check on me anyway without me needing to pay for it on my own. \nI think a lot of it has to do with good reviews and the timing / number of applicants on each job posting. Good luck!"

I can definitely see why you've never had a problem before. How long have you been applying for jobs. Just 2 days ago? If so, yeah, definitely give these people some time to sift through profiles and read applications. It definitely takes having some sit down time for some of these families. Also, with it being Valentine's Day i wouldn't be in a rush to hear things back this weekend, unfortunately. I applied for something at Disney and thought they just didn't pick me, number 1 because I don't live in that city, but then out of the blue weeks later I get a message saying that they've been swamped and the mom is having her assistant to holding her to having to pick someone within one day. This care thing can be just very much a side thing for parents and they get around to it when they can.\n\nHave you by any chance moved your pay rate range since the last time you were applying. Also, not sure what particular thing you don't meet why you don't have a carepro badge already. You should look into that.\n\nYou should definitely be using your premium subscription to look at your stats and reach out to families who have seen your profile. Even if they don't have a job posted they may have a job. Sometimes something just wasn't clear on your profile(although not sure what that could BE right now) and they don't bother to stop and ask. If anything, you definitely should see if you can get some feedback from the \"stats\" families. They can sometimes reply a lot sooner because they remember actually seeing your profile before.\n\nIf anything, I just think having a background check on file makes adds to the \"professional\" vibe. Like you come fully prepared. You know what I mean? If you keep having no response definitely give it a try to add it. There have also been more incidents where parents are a lot more weary these days of who they hire offline.\n\nGreat profile, Katie! Definitely let me know if it keeps happening or what the feedback is and I will brainstorm with you some more. :)"

	"text": "To add & stay fair, not every past nanny may be available or they could have been the issue. I think it us fair to ask & maybe find a way to suggest the history if the past nannies are not available for whatever reason. Some people will be honest & explain what happened. Sometimes neither Nanny or Employer is a nightmare persay, but it just didn't work out for both parties. I have asked for copies of Employer's IDs in the past (only once they have mine or requested mine). I think it is fair that Employers feel safe & are given the opportunity to run a  background check or confirm references as they are bringing the Employee into their home & trusting them with the most important thing their children. Only an Employee that might be hiding something unfavorable might refuse this request. My opinion is as the Employee, you have the right to have the information & decide for yourself. Employees & Employers vary so much, in so many ways! What might be an issue for one, isn't for another. An example I can give is while interviewing with a couple of a newborn (their first) they asked if I would be ok with cameras in the common areas & baby's room. I responded, \" I do not LIKE being on camera or being watched. But this is your CHILD, you have every right to feel safe while leaving her in my care so yes I would be fine with that\". I also advised them (as a Mother as well), \"If someone does not agree to it there may be a reason why & you may want to consider that a red flag\". So many variables! I am not even going into the horror stories of employees stealing or abusing the children, or where Employers have abused or put the Employee in dangerous situations. But to end, I do believe there can be a happy medium if you are prepared & ready to state what is acceptable & what isn't for you."

You need to have a clear and informative profile/bio listing your experience, certifications /CPR/first aid, education, etc. Be mindful of grammar, spelling, and punctuation. If you can afford to purchase the membership, do that. With the membership you'll be notified of new jobs in your area, remain higher in the search results, and you'll be able to communicate with all of the families you apply to, instead of just those families who have the membership. If you can afford it, purchase a background check. This is not totally necessary. If a family wants you to do a background, they can request it through Care and they can also pay for it. :) Apply to as many positions as you can, all that fit your needs and schedule. It may take families several days or several weeks to reach out to you, because they have several applications to sort through and decide which caregivers they will interviewed. Be patient. It can be a long process. Ask you past employers, family, and friends to post reviews for you. The reviews will give the families an idea of your character, how well you work with children, and your work ethic. You can also visit the topics area to find lots of information, advice, and tips. Good luck to you, Michelle!\nBest regards, \n\ud83d\ude0a Kelly K"

My duties include picking up 1 year old from day care, feeding her, napping her, doing dishes/ putting them away, laundry, and cooking. Also includes meal prepping for her, her husband and the baby.

She needs me to work Monday to Friday 4-8 sometimes even later. So 20 hours a week which is 80 hours a month which is $1000 which means it's $12.50 and hour which is below minimum wage where I live minimum is $15 an hour. Also if I babysit for her on the weekends she said she will only pay me $12 an hour. I told her I didn't want her offer. Without my consent she purchased a background check and she blew up my phone the next morning with texts and calls because I was sleeping she started at 6 AM. When I finally answered she said she needed me to answer my phone right away. I said I'm sick I don't need to answer right away. She knows I'm pregnant 6 months and I had already told her I get morning sickness. Anyways how do I quit without her coming back at me.

I\u2019m going to hide my bio, but my 1st pic has always been the same, a close up summer pic. No not a bathing suit, just palm tree in the back. I also do recommend getting a background check and premium acct, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d have the positions I do now without getting it. The good thing is you can just screenshot the background check and when the \u201ctiming\u201d expires in 90 days and you\u2019re asked to get a new one, you\u2019ll have it saved. Also, when families really want the background check and you send them the out of date one (which they typically don\u2019t notice)... They will then upgrade their own acct in order to get your updated background check or whomever the other contenders are. Once you that happens, you\u2019ve scored, because you now have access and can take pics of your new background check. It also will up your rating by HUGE because when a family req your check you get to view it, it shows on your acct you have a background check, & you can send it out to potential clients! Definitely place a pic of yourself on your profile, as well. So many new people looking for a nanny, see a baby pic and assume you are either looking for a nanny, as they are, have something to hide, or will be bringing your child with you while watching theirs. Although a couple of those may be true, you\u2019ve gotta show your face, not a selfie though."

	"text": "Hi Danielle :) I don't necessarily need to say this again lol but just so you have ease of reference of where I am coming from. I have helped over 140 families this past year. Spoke to soooooooo many more who found me themselves, but I turned them down, various reasons. So how many hundreds of families I've spoken to be now. Who knows? Now that this is done sounding like an egregious braggadocious beginning to a novel about me lol I say aaaaallll that to say, I can certainly tell you what I have heeeeard from parents. I know I wasn't supposed to say this but I feel truth is valid here, but if you don't have a background check on file already you are making it oh so much more difficult for families to select you. The process of care itself is already very overwhelming for parents and the simplest thing they can immediately do to cut down on decisions is cut down folks who don't already have a background check on file. You can think of it like that's one of their requirements to make it to the next round. If you don't pass that round then you will never GET the chance to show them your background check. Make sense?\n\nNext. Reviews. I've talked about this A LOT in the last 2 days, I refuse to say how many I personally have lol but I've been at 0 and I've been to not 0 so I know the process and what changes. If you have ever looked for anything online I'm sure you've consulted what past folks have said, parents approach this process in a not so different manner.  Hope this helped. :) Feel free to click into my profile for more tips I've left on getting reviews."

Your family can still do background checks by having the caregiver make a free account on Care, if the family already has a paying one, and request the background check through the site.\nIt\u2019s so nice of you to help them, and nice of your family to make accommodations so you can stay on with them \ud83d\ude0a Good luck!"

Parents also take a look at your experiences, education, age, what else you do beside providing care for kids.... You can try 1 month premium with a promo code (~ $17) or $45 for up to 6 months by Facebooking them. The advantage of having the premium is to show up higher in the search result from parents, you get a free motor vehicle record check with the badge on your profile since the background check is expensive, but the CARECHECK is free and a plus too, you get the daily alert email to apply for jobs ahead of those that don\u2019t have the premium and you can message back and forth all the parents.\nYou can check out other topics in this platform relating to your concern. \nA premium still will not guarantee you a job ASAP but it can be helpful since there are other factors mentioned above that go into finding a job.

I usually keep a motor vehicle record check on my account to give access to a new family & when those new families request a full background check, they\u2019ll pay for & request that through the app.\n\nIn all seriousness though, once you do find the right fit with a family and get to show them how mature you are and how passionate you are about working with children, you\u2019ll be able to request a review from that family- which will in turn help you find more nannying jobs! It\u2019s a win, win really because any experience is great experience to help shape what you\u2019re looking for in a position and that\u2019ll always change over time because we\u2019re all growing and learning.\n\nI\u2019ve been doing this for about five years now and I have to say it has seriously been the most incredible experience. Don\u2019t be discouraged if people don\u2019t reply right away because eventually it\u2019ll happen! Just keep sharpening your profile up and building it as much as possible!

I have done interviews with clients in the past on this site and if they liked me and wanted to hire me they go and do their own Background checks on me and get references from people I let them call from previous job.  Not everyone wants to give their personal information out to  a site.  Also the people who need caregivers are being blocked as well.  People use this site because its simple, pay your money.  Make an application for a job or caregiver.  Why? Because nursing homes are Expensive and they cant afford it.  Because they live on a simple social or pension.  Agencies cost a lot for them and are too complicated.  I know.  So they rely on a private caregiver.  However the caregiver has no protection so they have to be careful as well And make suitable choices.  Either way whether or not you do a care check Your site can't protect Anyone!

And yesterday (3 weeks after I signed up) I accepted a full-time job long term job. I did have about six interviews in that time as well. On here you can not half ass it. You have to do everything the sight has to offer and really apply everyday and in the messages you send to the family write down everything you offer. Even if it is your bio all over agin because honestly they don\u2019t ready your profile most of the time, they only read what you send them. Put a CLEAR picture of just yourself as well. Good Luck"

	"text": "Building off what everyone else has said, I have some additional tips to elaborate on and increase your odds based on my past experience.\n\n1. Profile Bio \u2014check spelling, grammar, presentation, and flow as you highlight experience, certifications, past experience(s), special skills, volunteering in the community, and overall make yourself stand out.  This is one of the first things families see when evaluating compatibility to their needs.  Your bio is a business profile so make it look like one.\n\n2. References/Reviews \u2014having feedback on your profile makes a huge difference; if you\u2019ve done any childcare for friends, neighbors etc. in any capacity, see if they\u2019d be willing to submit feedback on your account.\n\n3. Background check \u2014this is another scale tipper; having this shows you are serious about services you provide.\n4. Letter of introduction/application \u2014Like your profile, check spelling, grammar, presentation and flow as you submit applications and even more important is acknowledging details from job posting.  For example, if a job posting needs someone willing to undertake certain responsibilities or certain days and times, say something like, \u201cI see you need someone Monday-Thursday 8am-3pm.\u201d Highlighting/mentioning specific details shows you read the job posting.\n\n5. Keep persisting.  There\u2019s no telling how many applications you\u2019ll have to send before you get a bite but it will pay off.  With enough effort,  you can find a good fit.\n\nI joined care.com back in fall of 2012 and in the beginning, I had 0 reviews on my profile, a basic membership, and a $7 background check.  I lost count on the number of applications I sent before finding my first family.  Flash forward to present day, I am now a premium member with CarePro badge, up to date background and MVR check, and over 20 five-star reviews with families reaching out on a weekly basis in hopes of enlisting my services.\n\nMannies may be the minority but that doesn\u2019t make us any less important; we all have something to contribute and make a long-lasting positive impact on future generations."

Not something I\u2019m interested in doing so I have to decline a lot of families. The golden rule is to stand out from the 300 other nannies in your area.

	"text": "I have been using care.com on and off for 3 years now and here are my suggestions:\n\n1. If you can pay for premium. It's kinda necessary for messaging, it boosts your stats, and you get a vehicle background check included in the price. Use the promo code CARESAVE for 20% off (I think?). I pay for 1 month at a time because if I get a job in that first month, I cancel my premium subscription. It does remove my background check, which is annoying, but I print it off to have in case my current family requests it.\n\n2. Make your application peppy and personal. Families want to see that you're excited to work with them. I start with \"Hello!\", add the phrase \"Here is a little bit more about me\" before diving into my credentials, and close it out with \"Your family sounds awesome and I would love the chance to work with you, even if it's just as a date night sitter!\" and always, always thank them for their time!\n\n3. Take an extra 5 minutes to personalize your application. Do they want someone with a car? If you have one say so! Do they want someone who can also tutor in math and you've helped kids with math before? Mention it! Half the time people are only looking at your application and not your profile, so list things like CPR training, skills, and whether or not you have a car. I have a base application saved and I add things specific to each application.\n\n4. Mention things other than childcare! They are bringing you into their family and want to know you! Talk about your hobbies. I mention that I like hiking, crafting, and science. It makes a huge difference and you seem like a more well-rounded person\n\nI hope this helps!"

And reviews are extremely helpful, that\u2019s your selling point, no matter how many skills you have whether it be for Child, Senior Care and etc. reviews are your TRUE SELF.

	"text": "Here is my exact response I just posted to someone else\u2019s question/inquiry about getting responses:\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, you are experiencing the \u201cnormal\u201d way things go here on care.com. You can apply, send follow up messages.....stand on your head and sing Mary Had A Little Lamb......and NOTHING can force a family looking for a babysitter/nanny to respond to or even acknowledge an application. Today 98-99% of people have no common courtesy and lack even basic common sense. I have three applications outstanding, dating back to late April. The position for each one is still showing as open. Two have been read, one still just says delivered. One of those that were read actually looked at my profile. They have each received my initial application and a follow up email from me, but still all I hear are crickets when it comes to those applications. Long story short.....once you have sent your application there is nothing you can do but wait.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been with care.com for just over two years. Every job I have found has been through them, with the exception of one. I have worked for six great families. Each had different needs as far as childcare. All were short term\u2014the shortest 6 weeks the longest being almost 7 months. I specialize in newborn and infant care.  All have been first time parents except one. They are either looking someone to care for their new baby until their daycare spot opens up, or until the baby is a certain age and then they go into daycare, and one family I cared for their newborn for about 3 months while the mom was ending her time in the military and going  through whatever it takes for processing out. I am at premium status because I feel that little bit of investment in myself has paid for itself.i also keep my background check and MVR report up to date, I also believe that helps in getting hired\u2014- by having it in hand when applying for a job."

I have seven 5 star reviews and have offered 3 people to contact for reference. I feel I am being put through hoops bye two first-time parents, perhaps because they work in business Staffing.\n They are very nice and cordial but I had to go and meet them for an interview and they told me I'm the only one they liked and they had 55 applicants. Next I had to go to his office with my driver's license and social for a criminal background check. All this for $15 hr\n So tomorrow I am supposed to go for what I thought is an orientation but the mom says she is looking forward to seeing me and I don't have to come early because it's just a trial. \nI feel kind of insulted as I've never experienced this before. I have always experienced parents who are happy and excited to have me as their caregiver. They also told me that both grandmas May pop over sometimes, am I getting into a bad situation?\n I am a grown woman and professional with lots of experience and I feel like I'm being put through hoops.

Or get the monthly premium $20/mo or $50/6mo to start it off as a trial so that you can have the free motor vehicle record check for free (good for 6 month even after your first premium of $20, if the background check is too costly for you). Get some reviews from the people you worked with. These will allow you to message parents back and forth, appear higher on their search list and apply for jobs ahead of those that don\u2019t have it. Don\u2019t wait for a parents to go the background check for you especially if you won\u2019t appear on their search list, your chances are slim. Remember that you are competing with highly qualified candidates based on their education, experiences, certifications, age and more. Good luck !"

That just allows you to communicate with the families you apply to, puts you higher in the search results, and allows you to be notified of jobs in your area. If you're referring to paying for background checks, that's optional, not necessary, and each caregiver's decision to make. I've never paid for a background check. I usually let the prospective employer request a background check through Care. That way it's at the prospective employer's expense, not mine. The CareCheck that caregivers are now required to do in order to use the website is free. It sounds like you were overcharged for a service. I'm glad you were able to recoup some of your money. I understand your frustration, but Care is not a scam. Care is basically a business to help families and caregivers connect. There may be many caregivers applying for the same job that you are applying to . Acquiring a good job takes patience and hard work. This is a competive field. We need to make sure we have a clear and informative profile/bio, knowledgeable experience, certain certifications, excellent references and reviews, a positive attitude, and patience. Keep applying to all of the jobs that fit your needs and schedule. I hope you continue to be diligent in your search and find a family that will be a perfect fit for you. You can try contacting nanny agencies in your area. I have found them to be very helpful and have acquired two jobs through an agency. Good luck! \nAll the best to you,\n\ud83d\ude0a Kelly K"

	"text": "Hey Kayla!\nI'll be extremely honest; as you're new, and with Covid such a gamechanger, it's not going to be easy =(\n\nEven for parents who ARE actively seeking nannies during this Pandemic, because of so many child caregivers being let go and fewer jobs being posted, in many areas, it's even more competitive than pre Covid. Parents may get 30-60+ applicants applying to their one job and most of the time you may be 'seen' but never get a reply either way, especially if they find someone they like. \n\nPlease ALSO be looking for jobs beyond here; don't just use this as your main job seeking platform and hope for the best. \n\nAnyways, with all that being said, a few tips (which you can also check in the 'popular topics' section on here)....\n\n-Make sure your profile bio has minimum grammar and spelling errors. Do NOT say anything about needing to work asap/needing money/saying you are a good Christian/Muslim/whatever woman, etc. \nAdd info like how much experience you have, your available schedule, any certifications, etc. \nDo NOT copy/paste your Profile bio to each message you send. Looks lazy. Send each parent a personal message. \n\n-Having a background check on file helps\n\n-Reviews help. If you have prior paid child care experience, a few reviews from those parents definitely helps. There's a link you can send through the Care site. I know many say that if you don't have child care reviews, use character reviews from friends/teachers/professors, etc but ultimately it's the child care ones that really look good (imo.)\n\n-For your safety, do NOT give access to your BGC, any references or a resume to any parent until after a thorough phone interview in which both parties feel comfortable going forward at minimum AND at their request. I never volunteer my BGC or references to parents unless asked. \n\n-Check the going rates in your area so you are not charging too low but also not putting yourself up so high that's not the norm for where you are. \n\nHope this helps and wish you well!"

You've been working in childcare your whole life so definitely I hope you can reel in some good reviews from some folks. Hopefully, your \"cared for\" number will also follow closely when you gather your reviews(that's a whole other issue which I'm not certain has been resolved on the website yet).\n\nPlease get CPR and First Aid Certified.\n\nIf you can add a background check that would also be great, they last a couple of months.\n\nMake sure you update your availability calendar. Since you are looking for full-time, just fill it out with what you are ideally looking for in schedule in a position not the actual availability on the given dates(a limitation of the website).\n\nWay to go Premium! Yay for Grace!!! :) If you could definitely utilize that and check out your \"stats\" often and send a message to the folks who have been looking at your profile. I have some \"tricks\" for sending over a \"resume\" if you'd like. But if you can figure out what you think would be your best way to sell your experience to folks in a short message, I'd love to hear what you come up with. I love that you are coming to the table with tons of experience so a lot of the hard part is done, you just have to master how to present that experience quickly and efficiently.\n\nGrace.....my friend...you have HOW many siblings??? Geez louise! Never lacking a friend in the house I guess. lol\n\nIf you need some help on editing your paragraph, the ladies on the forum are always happy to help edit and draft. Just create a posting and let them know that's what you need help with and post your draft. At least a few people should jump in and help.\n\nDEFINITELY, let me know if you have any questions, Grace. I'm invested! :) You should do great!"

I\u2019m wondering if, for that shift in particular, if I could take the child to a play place I discovered for babies that\u2019s 10 minutes from their home so he can play. There aren\u2019t really any good parks within walking distance of their home, and I just didn\u2019t want to be cooped up with him all day, ideally, if I have to though, I have to. \n\nDoes anybody know how I could ask them about this?? I do have a motor vehicle background check they can view on Sittercity which is the site I found them on. \n\nAnyways, advice appreciated :) thank you!"

Granting access to your background checks should be one of the final things you do before being hired by a prospective employer. Don't grant access to your background checks to everyone, because it's not necessary unless a prospective employer is truly serious about hiring you. If you haven't already purchased your background checks, STOP \ud83d\uded1, don't do it. If a prospective employer would like to run background checks on you, they can request a background check through Care and it will be at their expense, not yours. Good luck! \ud83d\ude0a"

I don\u2019t want a bunch of potential employers I\u2019ve never even met calling a bunch of people I know now. One of my references is a family down the street whose children are in high school now, so they don\u2019t need a sitter anymore. I don\u2019t want to bombard them with phone calls, especially since I see them quite often. Another reference is a family I worked for and they moved out of state for the husband\u2019s job. Both parents work A LOT and they have three kids, they are really nice people, but I don\u2019t think they have time to take every call from a potential employer. I always ask first too, so it puts me in an awkward position, calling them every time I get a phone interview asking \u201cis it ok if (so and so) calls you for a reference?\u201d Once I\u2019m done with the in-person interview, and I feel it\u2019s right for me, I then email the potential employer my references. I just don\u2019t feel right giving someone\u2019s full name and phone number out to a total stranger, especially with all the scamming going on around here. We meet first, if the job seems promising and feels like a good fit, THEN I will give my references and authorize a background check.\n\nLast month, there was a \u201cmom\u201d on here, who wanted to conduct a background check and call my references before we even met and she wanted to meet at her house. The job offer seemed way too good to be true too. She told me she works from home, I could bring my kids (my kids are in high school and don\u2019t need a sitter, but I mentioned them and immediately she said I could bring them without knowing their ages), the hours are flexible and the job pays $30/hour for one special needs child. I found it really odd and didn\u2019t give her any further info. If any parents have a problem with that, oh well. My safety and my children\u2019s safety comes first."

She posts that she is offering 25/hour. Says she will provide food, and that she will bring them to my house in the morning and pick them up after her shift since she works very close to my apartment, closer than hers. Said her son has a lactose allergy, no problem, we met, hit it off, really seemed like a great fit.. she asked if I would do over nights from like 8pm-530am sometimes as she is a nurse.. and then, says she pays 25/DAY and 30/NIGHT when I do over nights. I was slightly confused and thought maybe she made a mistake. I said, a day? She said, yes, 25 a day. ......... that averages out to around $2 an hour..\n\nWhy advertise 25 AN HOUR when you're really going to offer 2 bucks an hour? I told her I would charge at LEAST 600 a week for that kind of care (the area I live in, is very low income right now. I'm in a military community way up north and the going rate for a nanny here is like 300-350 a week with 5 hours a day/4-5 days a week)..\n\nAny advice?

Both schools had my name as an approved pick up and I was also an emergency contact. If I went to the office I had to show my ID but in the carpool line, they just call out the number on the placard. Both were smaller schools and the carpool staff soon learned my car (which was less common model) and my face. At the Catholic school I went into the classroom because at one point I wanted to be a teacher so I observed that little girl\u2019s class for about an hour. I just showed ID and the teacher told the office I was coming. Parents and grandparents/relatives could also go into the classroom to read as a volunteer thing. When I was an intern placed at a high school in Charlotte, I was technically not staff at the school; I was staff at an outside organization that places social workers and other human service professionals inside schools. So they have your own badge and office, and have to be approved by the school with background check, but it\u2019s still not a school employee. I had to be approved, too, and was labeled as a volunteer. This was at a title one school in not the best area in Charlotte so security is actually vamped up a bit in theory, but when I did classroom runs, no one ever questioned my status. I personally think there should be better standards and have them statewide at every school, public, private, or charter."

I have honestly come to this conclusion because I am not seeing this on competitors sites or through local job boards. \n\nOn the caregiver end of this site, I get a lot of replies but never any follow up and I have a 5 star rating and 10 years of experience. I\u2019m also a mom. So that brings me to the employer end of the site. Again, I got some replies to my post, but again...no follow up from the sitters who applied. I ended up hiring someone from a competitor. I don\u2019t know, maybe Care needs to do better screening or perhaps it\u2019s their app/website? Sometimes I get my notifications hours or even a day late. But I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s limited to that problem. I saw someone suggest that the market is oversaturated, but I babysit in the same area I needed to hire someone and there aren\u2019t that many applicants so I am very confused by all of this. \n\nI have been working with the same family for a few years now and unfortunately their son is starting school an hour later than he did the last 3 years and this doesn\u2019t work with my school schedule. 3 years ago, I was choosing between three good job offers when I started school AND had less flexibility. Very fast follow up too. The market around here isn\u2019t oversaturated at all, so I don\u2019t get it. Maybe the competitor (which I won\u2019t mention because they may delete this post) is taking their business, as it\u2019s free for everything...even the background check. I was referred by a fellow sitter. Maybe that\u2019s a good hint."

I've worked for several families who did not have premium for whatever reason, that's not my concern.  Again, these are MY feelings & opinion on the subject. I am the one looking for employment in a vast pool of caregivers. Each family is in their own space, faced with what I feel is probably a daunting, overwhelming task just posting for a caregiver and then wading through the applications that they receive. I want to do whatever I can to put myself out there, be noticed above other applicants. If that means premium and paying for my own background check, then that is what I do.

What the family claims they are willing to pay is usually much higher than a normal rate. Everything looks great, but they will state that a background check and/or motor vehicle check is required. Once contacted, they may ask for your personal information so that they can run your background check without you having to pay. This is likely a scam and a way to steal your identity. An employer on this site should never ask for your personal information. I\u2019m posting this just so caregivers are aware of this happening and to hopefully save some people from identity theft.

Parents are going to want to make sure they\u2019re having a really recent one, and if they were willing to pay for it themselves, they are probably going to be very stingy payers as well.

It\u2019s nice to be able to be one of the very first people to message them, especially if they are in need of someone quickly. Without the premium, oftentimes you won\u2019t even see a listing until there are 20th 30 applicants. People cannot see or respond to your post unless they have premium if you don\u2019t. In other words, one of you has to have premium to be able to communicate back-and-forth. \n\nI\u2019ve had quite a few people contact me to offer me jobs who never even put up an ad. My last 2 jobs I\u2019ve gotten that way - and they didn\u2019t bat an eyelash when I wanted a couple $ more than the 24-year-old they\u2019d had.

Tell them about experience and even hobbies and educational things that are relevant to making you a good caregiver.\nIt\u2019s best to do the actual applications fairly individually, tailoring them to the specific family. For instance, if they have young children, I tell them crafts and outing things I like to do with little ones. If they want someone who will be comfortable with dogs, I tell them about growing up with big dogs and having done rescue. These individual things are things you should be looking for to know if a family is suited to you so you don\u2019t waste time applying to jobs that really aren\u2019t going to be a good fit. Read between the lines and consider all the info they give you. For instance if they say the want coverage from 6 am-12 am (midnight) M-F, but have it listed as part time, they may want to tie up your time all week, but only have you work (and get paid) for 15 hours a week. Or they may just think 12 am is Noon and need just mornings.

When I look for potential jobs on care.com, I completely skip over any family without a profile picture. I\u2019m sure the parents do that when looking for babysitters as well.

	"text": "Hello, I have been with care.com for  3+ years and feel strongly no one is seeing my posts at times.\n2)  I love the idea of having our own group but do you think some sort of screening should be done for new people who want to join or no??  Also, has wanted background checks for members these days which I am fine with, but just food for thought for our group for future reference.  With this in mind, for the group to grow and have longevity attributes, should we have a rule or something that background checks are okay to do if you want to include that in your blog but it's not required???   This is what I would propose and I do think it should be up for discussion.   I do like the word \"ultimate\" as a possible term to be used in the motto of the group.  For instance, the motto might say \"get ultimate care for multiple types of care\" or something to that effect.   Just a suggestion!!   \nAgain, regarding the background check,I think it should not be required but okay if you want to include it in your blog if you have gotten one yourself.   Any other options?  I have not gotten one yet through CC as u have been thinking of quitting with them anyway.\n2)   What about new caregivers who want to join?   What rules, if any, does the group want to implement?  I gave one example above about background checks!  I just think if we have no plans at all in this regard, we could get a bad reputation really quickly if someone with no experience at all gets hired under our name, for instance someone who might be on drugs.  Am I reading too much detail into this??"

No sane person is going to have you pick up their child from somewhere without you having met them and the children. Do NOT send your email anymore - too many crazies out there. People who pay the best of people who are going to want good security for their children, especially if they have any kind of high profile job like this woman seems to have. They will want someone who is aware of security issues and I had to protect themselves as well as their family. I always text back-and-forth at least for five times to make sure the job is what I really want as far as ours, what duties are involved, pay scale, etc. Then I will either ask them for their phone number or send them mine or send them mine. You really can\u2019t block someone from an email account or just change your email account name because the email name is always out there, plus I want to hear their voice and see if we \u201cmesh\u201d. And until someone is going to fill out a W4 with you for the job with their accountant, they\u2019re not getting your drivers license. As far as making sure you\u2019re a safe driver and a safe person, they can pay for a background check and an MVR check through care.com. That way they will have the information they need, but they will not have your personal information. Personally I think this is probably a scam to steal your identity."

	"text": "![Home Care Service](https://image.freepik.com/free-photo/closeup-support-hands_53876-14962.jpg \"In-Home Care\")\n\nIn-home care can significantly improve the wellbeing and quality of life for seniors. They reduce the need for hospitalization and allow aging seniors to recover from an illness or injury in a familiar environment. Thus, professional in-home care is an ideal choice if your senior parent or elderly loved one needs more help living independently that they did before.\n\nHowever, choosing an ideal in-home care service can be a rollercoaster ride, especially with the sea of options available today. Knowing what qualities to look for in such home-care service providers can help you make a suitable decision, allowing your senior to live a comfortable and independent life.\n\n##**1. Strong Reputation in the Senior Care Domain**##\n\nThe first quality that sets an in-home senior care provider from the others is their reputation in the domain. Reputable and experienced in-home care agencies will be talked about by their clients. They carry excellent client reviews and positive comments on their company website, social media channels, and Google reviews.\n\nFurther, established in-home care services are transparent about their licenses, certifications, accreditations, care plans, and the costs. Make sure you gather the following information to gauge the agency\u2019s trustworthiness and expertise in senior care.\n\n*   How long have they been in the senior care segment? Who\u2019s the founder? Go through their company history and read about them on Google.\n\n*   The licenses, accreditations, and awards they have received\n\n*   The senior care plan they offer\n\n*   What type of training do they conduct for their staff?\n\n*   Contact information of a few of their clients\n\nYou don\u2019t want to compromise on offering the best care for your aging loved one. Use this information to determine whether or not you are dealing with a reputed and trustworthy senior care agency.\n\n##**2. A Skilled Team of Professionals**##\n\nBefore selecting an in-home care service, it\u2019s important to interview their team and assess their expertise in senior care. An ideal in-home care service provider will proudly talk about their team and be open to organize an interview session for you.\n\nCheck whether the team of caregivers, aides, therapists, and nurses are qualified and experienced in elderly care. For instance, they should be able to help seniors with the [activities of daily living (ADL)](https://www.care.com/c/stories/15077/activities-of-daily-living/) like bathing and dressing and offer nursing care for an illness or a disability. Further, they should be experienced enough to recognize the mood and behavior of the aging senior and know how to manage them. They should also be able to handle their medical supplies with ease.\n\nConsider asking these questions to make an informed decision in this matter.\n\n*   What are the types of professionals do they have? Very few agencies have a strong team of registered nurses, physical therapists, memory care specialists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, nutritionists, and home health aides.\n\n*   How experienced is the staff? How long have they been with the agency and in the senior care field?\n\n*   Are they trained in senior care? How equipped they are to deal with emergencies? Do they possess the required certifications like CPR and first aid certifications?\n\n*   What kind of background check has been done before hiring the staff?\n\n*   Who supervises the in-home care professionals?\n\n*   Does the same care professional attend to multiple clients? OR Do they offer dedicated staff?\n\n*   What happens if the care provider doesn\u2019t show up?\n\n*   What\u2019s the insurance cover like? Will you be protected against thefts or loss of property due to accidents?\n\nBesides, ask for work and personal references to access their trustworthiness, punctuality, and ability to handle stress and emergency situations.\n\n##**3. Customized Senior Care Plan**##\n\nSeniors have a variety of needs. Some may require medical aid while others may just need assistance with their daily activities. The in-home care service provider you choose should be able to customize their care plans according to the needs of your senior.\n\nIdeally, in-home care service providers should offer the following types of home care for the elderly.\n\n**Private-Duty Skilled Nursing Care**\n\nThis includes a skilled nurse who\u2019s trained and experienced in providing care for seniors with diseases and disabilities, monitoring the vital health signs, administering medications, and using devices like the ventilator, catheter, and feeding tube. If your senior needs long-term nursing care, this is the in-home service you should opt for.\n\n**Home Health Aides**\n\nThese are non-medical care professionals who help seniors with ADL, meal preparation, and other household tasks, allowing them to live an independent and safe life. They offer companionship to seniors and engage them in hobbies and recreational activities. This service is ideal for seniors looking for assistive care and companionship (not medical care).\n\n**Home Health Care**\n\nThis includes short-term physician-prescribed care to cater to a specific illness or injury. The visiting nurse, clinician, or health care aide is an expert in offering physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other services until the senior recovers.\n\nBefore making a decision, check all the services offered by the in-home care service provider and choose the one that best caters to your needs.\n\n##**4. Quick Emergency Response Services**##\n\nHow adept is the care provider to the change in your need? A senior\u2019s needs can change suddenly. At one moment they may need assistive care while on another day they may require a skilled nurse to care for a sudden illness or accident. The service provider you choose should be able to quickly adjust to these changes.  \n\nFinally, does the service provider have backup care in case your in-home nurse or caregiver doesn\u2019t turn up? They should be well-resourced to offer a skilled professional who can effortlessly fill a shift or two. Further, not all home care service providers are available 24/7. So, it\u2019s critical to check whether they are contactable round-the-clock to cater to emergencies. \n\n##**Wrapping Up**##\n\nIn-home care is the most suitable option for seniors who desire to live a comfortable, safe, and independent life in their homes. However, not all in-home care service providers can be trusted to offer the same level of senior care. Therefore, it\u2019s important to research well before opting for one.\n\nConsider the information shared in this post to offer the best quality care for your senior loved one in their aging years.\n\n\n**About the Author:** \n\nAmie Clark is the Co-Founder, Senior Editor, and the visionary behind [The Senior List](https://www.theseniorlist.com/).

It's up to you whether or not you want to do the free CareCheck, but I'm not sure you'll be able to use this site to find a job if you don't have the CareCheck on file.

Until that gets fixed it will most likely be nearly impossible for parents to feel comfortable to reach out to you. They are hiring strangers online so they need at least some level of checks and references on the person they select. In that same regard, a background check would be great. Premium, however, won't necessarily add anything for you until you have some reviews. Feel free to search the board for tips on reviews or search through some of my past evals and comments.\n\nLet me know if you have any questions. :)"

	"text": "How many jobs have you actually applied for? If you\u2019re a nanny/babysitter/caregiver it is not very likely that you will receive a job offer based on application alone. If you have submitted an application to someone they may or may not respond. Most do not respond, unless they are interested in interviewing you for the position. It is very rare that you get a response telling you that the position has been filled or something to that effect. I have 6 or 7 applications outstanding. I have actually corresponded with a couple of them. The others still have their position showing as open and I have followed up on every initial application. I keep the applications open until I see that the position has closed. I have been a member of care.com for about two years.  I am a premium member and that is no guarantee of acquiring a job. Having a background check and your MVR available is definitely helpful. Yes, you have to pay for it, but I find it\u2019s worth the money because many seeking care for their babies /children want to see a background check.  The only thing that you can do to \u201cconnect\u201d with a family is to submit an application and wait."

It seems where I live there have been men looking for a \"Housekeeper\" to clean their home but once you respond to them saying you're interested in cleaning for them the conversation takes a creepy and dark turn. It's really upsetting when this happens because we all are looking to make money and I get so excited when I think I'm about to get a job and then it turns out it's just some creep trying to get a female to his house. We really do need to look out for one another so thank you Lailatou for letting us know how we can report these jerks. It's scary and very frustrating because I think yes I'm finally getting a job and then it turns out to be something completely different and I've wasted all my time for nothing! Care does need to have a list of these people whose intentions are not good. Especially, for the cost to have a premium membership, then it's extra for a background check, DMV check and there might be more I'm not sure? After all, we're not a dating site!"

I let the family pay for my checks, and in my applications I just say \"I am willing to complete any background checks or drug tests you require.\" At first, it was just because I didn't want to pay for it until I had serious interest. But then I learned that there's the option for the families to pay for it, so that's what I did. If you are looking for exclusively date-night gigs, you may want to consider paying for them yourself; that's probably what I would do. I was looking for a long-term position, which I expect the nanny family to pay for. It's up to you. \nAs far as what to do first, make sure your profile is complete with a well-written, professional bio and at least 3 reviews (you can request them from anyone). Are you CPR certified? Make sure all of your qualifications, including CPR, are listed. If you don't have it yet, you can put in your bio or application the date that you expect to receive it. Having proper grammar and punctuation is crucial, as parents want to see professionalism and want someone who will teach their kids proper English. I would also consider changing your photo to one where you are looking at the camera. \nYou can search through the topics on here for more tips; this is just to get you started. There's tons of advice and tips on this board for getting started and landing positions. You're going to need to be patient. Many don't realize when they sign up for Care that it's not an instant, guaranteed job site. It'll take a lot of work, patience, and possibly some luck, depending on your area and qualifications, to land a position. But there are others who get lucky and land a position within a week. It's on a person-by-person basis, but it's best to go in with the expectation that it can take some time. \nGood luck, Mary! I hope you stick around on this board (:"

Therefore it will be hard to get back to each candidate. Sometimes they even forget to close the job or changed their ,ind because they found a friend or family to step in. They are so many reasons.

My mother's cleaning lady won't change bed sheets or wash any dishes but our previous one would change sheets and wash any dishes left in the sink (usually only a couple). Include descriptive wording about yourself, if you're detail-oriented etc. Also, mention if you're pet-friendly since many families have pets.

If you can, pay for premium. It's kinda necessary for messaging, it boosts your stats, and you get a vehicle background check included in the price. Use the promo code CARESAVE for 20% off (I think?). I pay for 1 month at a time because if I get a job in that first month, I cancel my premium subscription. It does remove my background check, which is annoying, but I print it off to have in case my current family requests it.\n\n2. Make your application peppy and personal. Families want to see that you're excited to work with them. I start with \"Hello!\", add the phrase \"Here is a little bit more about me\" before diving into my credentials, and close it out with \"Your family sounds awesome and I would love the chance to work with you, even if it's just as a date night sitter!\" and always, always thank them for their time!\n\n3. Take an extra 5 minutes to personalize your application. Do they want someone with a car? If you have one say so! Do they want someone who can also tutor in math and you've helped kids with math before? Mention it! Half the time people are only looking at your application and not your profile, so list things like CPR training, skills, and whether or not you have a car. I have a base application saved and I add things specific to each application.\n\n4. Mention things other than childcare! They are bringing you into their family and want to know you! Talk about your hobbies. I mention that I like hiking, crafting, and science. It makes a huge difference and you seem like a more well-rounded person\n\nI hope this helps! Just have a little patience too!"

However, I agreed because the jobs I take on the weekends are a first come first serve type system. \n\nShe called me to do an interview over the phone and it was pretty intense tbh. Afterwards she emailed me a 4 page nanny application to fill out with a background check. Upon arriving to her home she asked me for my driver license and then went upstairs to make a photo copy.\n\nHas anyone has this happen to them before?? Is this normal?? Don't get me wrong, I love the precautions she's taking. But at the same time she now has a ton of my personal information. Also, this is for a date night type position, not a full-time nanny position."

	"text": "Hi Lisa! Make sure you have a profile photo. A nice, professional-looking head shot; you don't need to pay for a professional photo, but it should look professional, if that makes sense. Make sure your applications are tailored to each job posting so that families know that you are actually interested in working for them and have made the effort. I write mine like cover letters. Also, excellent grammar and punctuation are imperative in applying for jobs. If you are not a strong writer, I recommend asking someone who is to proofread for you. The background check for your profile is a good start but what else have you done? Are you CPR & First Aid certified? That's a must for caregivers. You'll be alone with their children and they will want to be assured that you will know what to do in case of an emergency. Do you have any reviews yet? You can receive reviews from people you haven't worked for through care. There is a link you can send to anyone who is willing to provide you a review (coworkers, past employers, volunteer connections, friends/family, teachers, etc.). Fill out a bio that has your education, experience, and certifications. Also put why you want to be a caregiver/nanny/babysitter/pet-sitter. Talk about your passion and things you love to do with them. List your characteristics that you make you an ideal caregiver (patient, active, crafty, baker/cook, loving, nurturing, etc.). \nLastly, try be patient. This is not an instant job site and can take a while for many to find a job. It's going to depend on the type of job you are looking for, your location, and you as a candidate with how competitive you are. You want to take your time to find the perfect family and not settle for something because you are desperate. Listen to those instincts. Care doesn't have the same safety net as an agency does, so if things go wrong, you're kind of on your own. \nGood luck, Lisa! I hope you stick around here and keep us updated (:"

Even if I could afford it, I wouldn't pay it just on principle, to be honest. Other sites and agencies don't require anything like that. I also didn't pay for the background checks. There's an option for the family to request one through Care and it allows the family to pay for it. The only thing you can't do without the membership is message families who also don't have a membership. But you can apply to as many jobs as you want.

Your calendar is updated with your availability and that you have a background check that's always helpful however with the shelter in place a lot of the courts are closed so they can't do a complete background check a lot of places are nervous to have anyone come around so that might be the problem a lot of people aren't going anywhere or hiring.

I appreciate it. \nI'll make needed changes. \n\n-To be honest I had a premium account for past 3 months until Feb.14th so the day you searched through it already finished (maybe even 6 months, don't remember exactly). At this point I'm not sure if I want to continue having it. Yes, I have gotten few messages and they were about elderly, disabled and regular toddlers but it was aprox.6 msgs in past 6 months\n-I need to reach out to my families again to get their reviews. I have in the past but it was forgotten and only one family responded. \n-Will definitely add/exchange some pictures. I think when I was uploading those that I have currently I was focused on pet sitting jobs for a little change/variety.\n-International DL ..haha not particularly fancy but that what I had in the past. Got a permit now so will also update it. Thanks for pointing it\n-My response is \"behind\" because I disabled text msg notifications, was getting annoyed with the 'daily jobs\" notifications\n-Great tip, if you suggest that for babysitting  background checks are pretty crucial it totally makes sense \n-Calendar needs to be updated. I just got back from 1,5 month of traveling and was not on top of it\n\n-What do you mean by with premium I could definitely capitalize on my review?\n\nThanks so much again!!"

My name is Shelby and I am currently a pharmacy student at _____. I noticed you are looking for a summer babysitter.

I have no problem with cooking, cleaning, laundry, or coming up with entertaining and educational activities. I am also CPR/first aid certified and I do have my own car. Included is access to my vehicle background check.\n\nI love going on hikes with my dog and swimming in Lake Michigan. I have experience tutoring kids in math, science, and Spanish. I have taken courses in Spanish, American Sign Language, chemistry, biology, and math through calculus. I also love anything that has to do with art: crafting, drama, dance, music, you name it. I have 15 years of dance experience and 7 years of theater experience. In the summers of 2013 and 2014, I was an intern with _____ Civic Theater where I would assist with their child theater program, so I also know how to teach a large group of kids.\n\nMy availability: As of right now I have completely open availability for this summer starting June 21. \n\nIf you have any questions for me please let me know. Your family sounds awesome and I would love the chance to work with you, even if it's just as a date night sitter!\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon!"

Don\u2019t read too much into that unless it just asks you over and over- that\u2019s a technical glitch and would be fixed with technical support. \nThe reason you are having more issues now is just that it\u2019s become more competitive.

I got in a car accident a few months ago so I\u2019m assuming this disqualified me from the badge if I were to run the check? Obviously if I interview with a family that wants me to drive their kids, I will tell them about this accident but I don\u2019t want to miss out on the opportunity to interview just because a parent sees I didn\u2019t pass the vehicle background check. I live in Dallas where accidents on the freeway are not uncommon and not always a sign of irresponsible driving (which was my case, I\u2019d explain the details to potential families). Should I run the check on my profile or just leave it undone?"

I need to know more information like what type of care they need, location, age and number of children, etc before I'll even consider further contact. \n\nScammers will try to hire you without ever meeting or a phone interview; big red flag.

Most families want a nationwide background check and that's exactly the type of background check Care does.

AND were a teacher for 25+ years?????? Come on! Those are incredibly desirable qualifications in a nanny.\n\nThe few things that I see that need changing:\n\nAt the top you currently have part-time \"babysitter\". You should probably switch it to \"nanny\" based on what you have told me.\n\nYou have CPR Training, but you are missing First Aid? That's actually the first time I have seen that in evals thus far. You took a course with someone that only offered CPR?\n\nIf you could get your response rate below <20 hours that would be great.\n\nIt's always great to add the background check if anything you makes you stand out as a prepared professional. \n\nAnd lastly, I would try to figure out the things that you are missing why you still don't have a carepro badge.\n\nOne of the best profiles I have seen thus far, Elisabeth!

When I put in my job looking for a nanny, I did not have premium because I didn't want to pay to find someone to watch my baby when I'd be paying that person lol. So I put it up and within a couple days I got over 75 messages from potential nannies. And I could only read 4 of them. The rest were blurred out because I don't have premium and neither do the nannies. So we can't message. So I'm here to tell you girls, the reason you aren't getting a lot of responses is because WE LITERALLY CANT SEE YOUR MESSAGE!\n\nI know from experience of applying to every nanny gig in my area that you get like maybe 1 response for every 50 apps.

I've been paying my membership dues and had no issues with Care or the individuals I've tutored. I do not do it as my primary source of income but do so as a side gigs from time to time.\n\n At the same time, I recently got notified by Care that everyone will have to go through background checks from now on. I understand where parents are coming from as wanting background checks for the nanny or caregivers who go to their home. At least, in my case, I've never had direct contact with the students(most of them who are adults in college) since I have tutored them online and many times with high school students with their parents present and with the ability to record lessons.\n\nI prefer the previous system where parents could request a tutor to get a background check, especially if the given caregiver(most of the time nanny) was going to go to their house and be with their children for extend periods times. However, in my case and I'm sure in others as well, who mainly tutor math online for one hour once a week, it seems like a little too much. \n\n Does this mean that those who no do not go through Care check, despite having reviews, will no longer show in the listing results, or will it mean that they will no longer have the ability to contact students?  \n\nPlease, be respectful in your replies. I wholeheartedly sympathize with parents.  At the same time, I think that different caregivers and tutors are offering very distinct services. Caregivers are taking Care of the children for extended periods and should be verified. Meanwhile, tutors are teaching a technical subject like math to college students(adults). And specific policies should apply in a case by case basis."

Conversely, caregivers need to know they\u2019ll be treated with respect, courtesy, and overall employed by a reliable, dependable, and trustworthy household employers.\n\nIn fact, anytime a new family contacts me, I ask for references of past caregiver(s) they\u2019ve employed previously to discuss aforementioned qualities.  If the family is unwilling to furnish the contact information, I\u2019ll break it off right then and there.  About a month ago, family reached out and at first, they had a timely response time answering my questions in detailed manner but when I followed up with my request for reference contact info, they gave the silent treatment and I sent a follow-up message that stated I wasn\u2019t comfortable offering my services to employers unwilling to provide contact information and that effective immediately, access to background check will be removed and all channels of communication will be closed off.  \n\nDodged a bullet there."

	"text": "I copied and pasted this from another post that I responded to a few days ago......\n\nI\u2019m sorry but every time I see a post along these lines, it amazes.....astounds.....even somewhat confuses me that those that are new seem to think that if they apply for 20, 30, even 50 jobs......that they will get massive responses. This site does NOT guarantee anyone a job. They are the middle man, the intermediary, the go between.....helping those seeking childcare connect with those who are looking for a childcare position and visa versa. If you are young and have little to no experience, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to find a job. If you are a college student who can only work certain days & certain hours and that changes with each semester, it\u2019s going to be difficult to find a position. Yes, I applaud you for your hard work & dedication in getting your education, but the majority of families are looking for someone full time or part time with set days & hours.\nIf I\u2019ve said it once, I\u2019ve said it a hundred times.....you can apply to one hundred jobs and beyond that with the exception of a follow up message (thanking the family from accepting your application and that you look forward to hearing from them soon) there is absolutely nothing you can do. A family listing a job may get dozens of responses. They may or may not read all of them. They may skim through and pick just a few. If you are not among the chosen few, do not expect any kind of acknowledgement. In over 2.5 years and the dozens of applicants that I have put out, I have received TWO responses that basically said \u201cthank you for your application, but we have decided to go in a different direction\u201d. One of you must have premium in order for messages to go back & forth. I see so many caregivers say \u201cI\u2019m no paying for premium. I\u2019m not paying for a background check. Those are the responsibility of the employer,\u201d Did you ever stop to think the potential employers are waiting for applications thinking \u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility to get premium or pay for a background check, if they want a job badly enough they will pay for it.\u201d Did anyone ever think of that? And if they want a background background check on every person that they interview, even four interviews add up to over $100. If one is hired, $75 down the drain. If no one is hired $100 gone for nothing. No one seems to want to look at both sides of the coin....job seekers OR potential employers.\nYou can have what you believe to be the best references, experience and application.....and you can stand on your head and sing Mary had a Little Lamb until pigs fly, but there is absolutely nothing that you can do to make anyone respond to your application, in any way-shape-or form.\nI have applied to a job, only to see the post vanish within hours. I (right now) have an application \u201copen\u201d that I sent out March 20th for a position that was to begin October 1st. The job is still showing as open. I would put money on they have hired someone and never closed the position. I have one that I applied for May 21st also to begin October 1st, I\u2019d bet the same happened with this one. I wish there was some way that we as caregivers could \u201cclean\u201d out our applications after say 3 to 6 months. There are problems with the site. The site is also a great tool and resource, but they make no guarantees and are not miracle workers.\nStepping down from my soapbox now........."

	"text": "TIPS FOR THOSE WHO APPLY AND GET 0 RESPONSES TO APPLICATIONS! \nTHERE IS HOPE RIGHT AROUND THE CORNER, MY FELLOW CAREGIVERS! \n\nI WAS IN YOUR SHOES TOO!\nMy heart goes out to all the new caregivers who have joined this community seeking help and advice about what to do to get a job on care.com after sending out so many applications, yet continue to receive no responses in return. I was in your shoes too when I first started out, and it is most frustrating. \n\nIT IS SURE TO CHANGE! READ ON!\nBut I want you to know that it will change! You can\u2019t give up! care.com is amazing! And I want to help you and tell you what helped me and changed everything so that now the people are actually messaging me with job opportunities that I am able to choose from! I have met the most amazing families on there and have a very full schedule and love my jobs.\n\nI know that other fellow community members have responded to your posts so well with great and wise advice, so you may have already figured out by now how to improve and get jobs.  But I decided to tell my story and how it worked for me and to put my ideas on one post, hoping that others will add their ideas to this post and people who need help can refer to it, instead of them to be all over the place.\n\nMY BACKGROUND:\nI have been babysitting since sixth grade and love engaging and playing with all age groups of children. They have always been my greatest joy and I adore them! I have worked with children for years in teaching Sunday school class, and worked for many years as a teacher in a private church school, and as the head leader for many years of a Gems Girls Club (like Girls Scouts) for a church and in our community, among other things. I also am an energetic, seasoned mother of three children. I have been married for 34 years to my supportive husband. He took care of me for many years when I was chronically sick with Lupus and MS. I am much better now! I also love to cook meals for families and clean houses too. \n\nI also am on care.com as a mother looking for babysitters, so I know what the employers are looking for in a caregiver and who they pass right by! So I have some advice about that as well to share.\n\nMY TIPS:\nNow that you know something about my work and personal history, I would like to give you some tips about how I got started and how I finally received job responses! \n\nPOST THAT PHOTO AND VIDEO RIGHT AWAY! A MUST!!\nBut first, let\u2019s focus on signing up on care.com. First, you should have had no problem filling out general info and verifying your social networks, (If your social networks are not verified, someone who is looking for a babysitter is thinking, what does she not want me to see on her social media? Why is it not verified?), picking out a very clear frontal photo to post and then posting a video. Wait! I notice most people chose not to post a video! But I feel this is very helpful! I use the photo booth video setting on my computer and set it in front of me and click on video and talk away. Then post it. It gives parents an extra feel for your special personality and see a bit of who you really are!! And I don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t post photos. When I look for a babysitter to hire, do you know that I skip right over you when I do not see a picture! I want to see what you look like before I even ask you to come meet my child! You really need to post a profile picture! Ask a friend to help! \n\n\nTWEEK YOUR BIO TILL IT IS CLEAR AND HAS ALL THE IMPORTANT DETAILS BELOW!\nWork hard at posting a clear down-to-earth bio about you and your love for children and your work with them growing up or whatever your life bio is. It should include your education, your experience working with children, why you love babysitting or what you like to do when you are taking care of kids (crafts, outdoors, homework help, etc.), and then add a sentence about you to make it personal, maybe about a couple hobbies you have and important character traits, like dependability and patience. (Some of these ideas were from a post I have read previously on care.com. They have so many helpful tips on every subject that you can refer to on their site!!)\n\nRECORD YOUR WORK HISTORY, EVEN INDIVIDUAL NANNY JOBS AND BABYSITTING JOBS, AND ALL JOBS PERTAINING TO CHILDREN OR NOT!\nWork History was a hard one for me to put on paper since I have babysat for so many people mostly long ago who have come and gone and I wanted to use the ones I wrote down as references for prospective employers to be able to call. But I came up with plenty, even from highschool days, and I know the people to this day. I didn\u2019t call all of them, but would have if I needed to. I also recorded the other work history mentioned pertaining to working with children and in the comments, I wrote about my unrelated jobs working at a bank, Dr\u2019s office, and dentist\u2019s office for years. \n\nSAFETY VERIFICATIONS: A MUST-HAVE!\nI think this is worth every penny to pay for to have on file. Parents always want this verified before they even consider you as their nanny or sitter. The money you spend for this will pay for itself when you get lots of jobs! They will come!\n\nKEEP YOUR AVAILABILITY CURRENT!\nI notice that it is pretty common that not many people keep up with this feature. It is very helpful if you do keep this up-to-date for the parents looking for babysitters! It doesn\u2019t take but a minute!\n\nAPPLICATIONS SHOULD BE A FRESH, CREATIVE, PROFESSIONAL MESSAGE FROM YOU EXPLAINING WHY YOU ARE RIGHT FOR THE JOB, INCLUDING THINGS BELOW! \nI highly suggest that you do not send the bio to the employer as your application!!! I get this all the time when I am looking to hire a babysitter. Boring!! Not personal at all! Lazy, in fact! It is annoying to receive the same thing as your bio, when you are asked to write the following:\n\u201cWrite a professional message explaining why you are right for the job. Mention your skills, work history, certifications, and anything that makes you stand out!\u201d \nBut, not many do this! That sentence is written by care.com on the application page! That is what they want you to write about on the application.\nI think it is pretty cut and dry and self-explanatory as to what to add to your application. And yes, they will see your bio too. Always proofread it and have someone correct your grammar and spelling. It is so unappealing. \n\n\u201cFOLLOW-UP\u201d in a couple days to see if they have hired anyone, and re-state why you are a good fit for the job,\u201d care.com suggests in one of their helpful articles on line. \u201cThey may have just forgotten you in the shuffle of applications flowing in!\u201d\n\nALSO, DON\u2019T FORGET TO:\n\nBE AMONG THE FIRST TO APPLY!\nBE PERSISTENT!\nRESPOND BACK BY THE MESSAGE DEADLINE!\nWHEN YOU DO GET A MESSAGE, AND THEY REQUEST AN INTERVIEW, BE ON TIME!!!\n\nSAMPLE APPLICATION:\n\nGood Morning, Kathy R,\n\nI was so excited when I read your job description! I just love working with your child\u2019s age group. I have been working with four to six year-olds for five years now at a kindergarten in my  town. I enjoy engaging the children in play, doing age-appropriate crafts, playing outside activities, teaching them in class, and so much more! \nI finished college with a business degree. I have CPR training, do not smoke, and have my own car.\nChildren of all ages bring me great joy! I also have experience babysitting for children of all ages for at least 10 years. \nI love to hike, swim, and draw. I would love to meet you and your child. I am dependable and patient and kind-hearted. I believe that I would be a great help to you with my experience. I have plenty of references that you can refer to. I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you for your time! \n\nRespectfully, \nSuzie Y.\n\n(I am no expert!! This is just my opinion and my attempt to help. Nothing is set in stone! Everyone has their own brilliant and creative way of writing. I just wanted to give a brief idea of what to write.)\n\nREVIEWS:\n\nTo me, this was the most important category that finally got the ball rolling and things happening for me on care.com! I think that these reviews are the #1 things parents look for on the the site! They are eager to see what people are saying about an applicant. If there are good reviews that say that their children love their sitter, that the sitter is reliable, and other good things, then they are going to message him/her over above someone with no reviews, for sure!\n\nSome have said how hard it is to get reviews. I thought that too. But I began asking people I babysat for in highschool! I even just asked people I have just been friends with for a long time or family friends who know my character, and who know how much I love children and how well I care for them and what kind of a devoted friend and loving mother I am. These people were thrilled to send a message to care.com. \n\nThere is a link you can send to their email, if you feel funny asking them verbally. The link asks them, and they send the link with their review back to your profile! VERY easy! I even put my profile on my facebook timeline. There is a link that promotes you and your care.com profile. Look for it on your page to do yourself! That may help you to get some babysitting jobs. I even posted it on all the local cities\u2019 support groups and market places and did get a few responses from there. This all gave me a good start. I would ask everybody I could think of for a review! \n\nBefore long, I started to get a handful of reviews dribbling in! I was so grateful, because soon after that, I received a couple messages, and the responses to my applications started to come! I was so excited. Time went on, and the reviews kept coming in, and I applied for more jobs and began to even be messaged by people looking for care! \n\nBut, once in a great while, the cycle stops for a short time. This, to me, means that I need to change things up a bit! Perhaps change my photo and make it more up-to-date! Or, tweek my bio a bit more! Change some wording and add some more creativity. Update my availability, check my work history and make sure I have added any new people that I have recently worked for on care.com too! \n\nBe sure to always ask the people you work for that have hired you from care.com for a review even after a good month of working for them. I know by then what I think about my new sitter and whether I think she is going to please me and be dependable or not and I know exactly what to say! I love writing reviews for my sitters. It is an honor. So don\u2019t be afraid to ask. On your profile, there is a place for you to just click on their name and request a review! Very simple!\n\nBENEFITS OF PREMIUM!\nA question a lot of you had was the question whether to pay for premium so you can be in the Pro care category, which is the top category on care.com. I have to say yes for sure, because if you don\u2019t, you will miss out on the full benefits of the site. Here are the benefits:\nYour profile will appear higher than others in the search results; you will be notified of jobs sooner than everyone else; You can see families who have not posted jobs yet; you will have multiple payment options; you can communicate with no conditions attached, etc. etc. You won\u2019t have to do this for too long, only till you get the jobs you need! Sometimes, a lower-paying monthly fee plan is offered out of the blue! So be checking for that on your page.\n\nDON\u2019T GIVE UP!\nMost of all, don\u2019t get discouraged! Be encouraged by the ones like me that go before you that started out JUST LIKE YOU!! We had to apply to tons of apps too, my friends, and go through the longgg agonizing days of waitingggg. But to me, it was not that bad at all. It was worth the efforts. And suddenly, it all comes together and yes! One day, it will happen!! You will jump for joy at that first new job, work it, and then get that great review! That review will lead to more and more!! Mark my words. Don\u2019t give up!! Thank you for reading my post and I surely hope even a bit of it has helped in some way.\n\n\n\nHERE ARE MY TIPS IN A NUTSHELL! \nIF YOU DO THESE CORRECTLY, I BELIEVE THAT YOU WILL GET RESPONSES AND JOBS!\n\n1.POST A CLEAR, FRONTAL PHOTO OF YOU WITH A SMILE! PARENTS WANT TO SEE YOU!\n2. MAKE A VIDEO! IT HELPS!\n3. VERIFY SOCIAL MEDIAS!\n3. TWEEK YOUR BIO WITH YOUR WORK EXP, EDUC, CHILDCARE EXP, PERSONAL  \n    TOUCHES, ETC.\n4. RECORD WORK HISTORY WITH BACKGROUND CHECKS- GO WAY BACK IF YOU HAVE    \n    TO, INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL NANNY JOBS!\n5. KEEP YOUR AVAILABILITY UP-TO-DATE!\n6. KEEP APPLICATIONS ORIGINAL, PERSONAL AND FULL OF HELPFUL INFO.\n7. ASK EVERYONE YOU KNOW WELL FOR REVIEWS AND EVERYONE YOU EVER WORKED  \n    FOR AND NOW WORK FOR! THIS IS YOUR ACE IN THE HOLE!\n8. PAY FOR PREMIUM! IT IS WORTH IT!\n\nNOW PLEASE ADD YOUR TIPS AND ADVICE BELOW ON HOW TO GET FAMILIES TO RESPOND TO APPLICATIONS! WHAT DO YOU THINK I LEFT OUT? PLEASE ADD!!! THANK YOU!!"

	"text": "Hi Sheila :)\n\nYour profile is actually pretty great!\n\nThere are only a few things I would point out.\n\nYour avg response rate needs to go down if possible. It's currently sitting at <14 hours.\n\nYou should fill out your availability schedule. It supposedly keeps you higher in searches to have something filled in.\n\nYou may want to add a background check and premium if possible. And you could use the premium and take a look at your \"stats\" and reach out to some of those families who have looked at your profile. If anything, maybe you would just get some feedback on why they didn't actually follow through on sending you a message.\n\nThe last thing that I would suggest that you possibly do is to take on a bunch of one time gigs with the sole purpose of collecting 5 star reviews. It should help to combat that missing half a star. The thing is that sometimes all parents really see when searching is your review rating so that might skip over you do to it not being a perfect 5 and they'll never get to see why it wasn't a perfect 5, which honestly is like super minor if anyone actually takes the time to read it.\n\nHope that all helps :)"

Another alternative is to apply for some part time jobs where parents are willing to let you bring in your kids. You can add that to your profile and also within each application you will be applying for. However, the pay rate is drastically low when you bring in your own kids because most parents want to compensate you just for paying attention to their own kids and not to decide or share it with your own. Additionally, you can look up many different topics from the popular ones to learn more about how this website works, tips and advices on how to learn a job as a new member. You can also open an account on other websites as well. Having a background check or motor vehicle record check and a premium or membership can be helpful too. But, care is not an instant job and you might be competing with highly qualified candidates in your areas or the jobs might be scarce. Having a college degree, many years of experiences, certifications, locations, what the job entails .... are factors that contribute to your lucks. Take care!"

They will request access and it's your decision if you want to grant it or not.  Scammers will be reaching out to get that information.  Don't just let anyone see it.   There should be an exchange of emails regarding childcare along with a call followed by an interview.   \n\nGood luck!\ud83d\ude0a"

	"text": "I didn't have any reviews when first joined and was able to land a full-time nanny position, so don't let that discourage you! Your area may be really competitive. Check the site or your app very often (several times a day) so you can reply to postings quickly. Trying to get a few one-time jobs to get some reviews like Maryanne suggested is a good idea. Definitely don't use your profile bio as an application, but it looks like you've already figured that out. I would even be careful using it as a template. I write my applications like cover letters, so once I created a basic nanny cover letter, I would use that as a template and tailor each one to the specific job posting. Use specific keywords and responsibilities from their job posting. That lets the family know that you actually read the posting and care enough to take the time. \nYour grammar looks great! That's huge and can definitely help you stand out. I see a couple of things you could change, though. I would say First Aid instead of 1st Aid. Also, are you certified in adult or pediatric or both? I would specify that. There also shouldn't be quotations around baby. \"A lot of experience\" sounds a little more professional than \"lots of experience\" in my opinion. Do you have an Associate's or technical degree in child development? Definitely be specific if you do have a degree. If not, it still looks good and you can leave it how it is. \nIf you have not undergone the background checks and don't wish to pay for them yourself, you can say in your applications that you have a clean record (only if you actually do) and are willing to undergo any background checks. That's what I did because I didn't feel comfortable spending the money when I was unemployed. The families have the option to \"request\" one which they then pay for after you accept. \nAlso, do you have any previous families that would be willing to provide references? I didn't feel comfortable listing my references on the site for anyone to see, but I would add in my application that I have references I can provide to them. My previous families wrote me reference letters, as well as gave me permission to provide their phone number and email for a direct contact reference, so that's the route I went. \nGood luck and I hope this helps! Hang in there and just keep applying!"

	"text": "I recently decided to add more clients to my work load each week since I\u2019ve had such great experiences with my current clientele. Searching for housekeeping jobs in around the same area, I came across a women looking for a housekeeper once a month. We exchanged messages and she went into further detail stating she would prefer one every week. She discussed her problems with her past housekeepers and why it never worked out for her. Fast forward, I went to a interview at her home in which she immediately hired me and tossed me her house key. I felt like she jumped the gun so I asked more specific questions about what she required of me and what exactly she was looking for. Mind you she hadn\u2019t even shown me her entire house yet let alone the rooms she wanted cleaned to give me a better idea. Throughout this interview she kept telling me \u201c she didn\u2019t know how to do this or how it worked\u201d so I basically took control and walked her through the interview. She made me aware she had a ring door bell and told me she worked for a company that made security systems. Both in which I had no problem with for she also ran a background check on me criminal, driving basically the works in which again I had absolutely no problem with and of course cooperated! At the end of the interview she kept asking if I liked her and thought it was a good fit, I was a bit uneasy about the way she handled things. She had said her previous maid service was using vinegar to wipe the floors down and shoving her Children\u2019s laundry in their closets. She explained to me her kids were the ones that caught them doing these things. Fast forward again against my better judgement I took the job. The  very next day she asked me for a picture of my drivers license and said she wanted to call my references( I assumed she had already), keep in mind I have this women\u2019s house key already. Again I cooperated, two days after that I get another text stating she would have company staying with her the week I was suppose to start and that the whole family would be home that week for her birthday. I felt really uneasy about for one cleaning up after another family and two the fact that I felt like I would be a disturbance to everyone in the home trying to work around them to provide the best service necessary. Still after all that I showed up a day early on time to clean her home per her request . Not only did I have to clean up after another family but they also brought their pets as well. This women already had pets of her own so it definitely added more work but I was willing because I love animals so it didn\u2019t really bother me much at the time . Prior to my coming to this home I had mentioned to this women that the home I cleaned  before hers required moving out services and a deep clean in the attic which the other girl I was working with at the time accidentally blew a bunch of debri that had gotten into my eye. Still with my eye red and irritated I tried to get this Womens house done for her birthday. She had a very detailed list for me, in which the family\nthat was staying with her at the time, provided for me. Her \u201cfriends\u201d followed me around the home while I cleaned asking me questions. Her kids had food all over their rooms with literally every piece of clothing they owned on their bedroom floors. Now she had mentioned to me, she had a extreme dust allergy and needed help decluttering but wanted her sons to do their own laundry and for me to just pick up their clothing and put it in their baskets. The home I was cleaning didn\u2019t even look close to being the same one I interviewed at. It was unsanitary, disgusting and honestly looked like it was done purposely because they knew I was coming. Do people really do this? It looked like the toilets hadn\u2019t been cleaned in weeks. I told her I would do extra tasks or odd errands to help her out as well but that would be a separate charge. I unloaded and reloaded the dishwasher 3 times, did 4 loads of laundry which didn\u2019t even put a dent in what I picked up (she said she only required me to do 2 loads) and took her husbands dry cleaning to a place of service. None in which I was paid to do. Back to the interview when she told me she liked to make people aware they were being recorded of her ring doorbell because she felt like otherwise it was a invasion of privacy. While I cleaned I noticed multiple\nsecurity cameras that were hidden yet I didn\u2019t say anything because it didn\u2019t bother me i had nothing to hide I just found it weird she had made a point to tell me about recordings and how she felt like it was a breach in privacy but failed to tell me about the other cameras in the home. All my other clients have security cameras of some sort or around the clock live recording, this does not bother me what so ever,  but what it escalated to in the end that now has made me really uncomfortable. Back to the job,  what would have been a 4 hour job had turned into a 8 hour job. My eye was swelling up so I decided it was in my best interest to go see a doctor. However I still took the dry cleaning to not ruin this women\u2019s birthday dinner. When I went to text her ( she told me not to disturb her for she was working for home) to let her know I was leaving I noticed I was sharing my location with her from my cell phone. I never share my location even with relatives, I keep that off for a reason because I feel like you never truly can control or know who can see your location. Once you open it up anyone is capable of hacking your device. As soon as I left the home it turned off. It creeped me out so bad that when I got to the doctor I checked again just to see if it was my mind playing tricks on me. Sure enough it was back on. I\u2019m assuming her being some security system specialist gave her the opportunity to hack my phone or go in my purse and switch it on because I never keep my phone on me while I\u2019m working around someone\u2019s home on their time in which they are paying me for. Just to prove I\u2019m not crazy she sent me a text once\nI was home saying she was glad I went to the doctor and made it home okay. I NEVER TOLD HER I WAS HOME. I decided to end my relationship with this client but fear she may have access to my phone this experience made\nme paranoid and I think all caregivers should beware and be safe please!"

The last thing is if you log in often you will always be on the first page when people are seeking services. Some don't like to seek that long when they need people asap. I'm sure those jobs are still open. People just want to assure they feel good about who is coming in their home. Hope this helps. Good luck!"

Will she give you time off to have the baby...lol.  Give a two week notice even if she offers you $20hr. This behavior is just the tip of the iceberg Bina, run as fast as you can. You have two weeks to put up with this then you can find another job or relax till your baby comes. She doesn\u2019t need your consent to do a background check and you\u2019re not obligated to refund the background check fee if things didn\u2019t workout. Good luck. Be strong and honest with her.

Also, I can go through a local agency for nothing and they also handle all the background checks - another thing Care charges for on top of their monthly fee. It\u2019s a bit excessive."

Many have sent me copies of the reviews and then copies of their correspondence with Care.com when the reviews failed to post to my profile.\n\nDespite dozens of emails and phone calls from many of my clients and from me, Care.com has not fixed the problem.\n\nHere is an email I just received from one of my clients who had just heard from Care.com:  \"Nov 26 at 4:33 PM\nI can\u2019t believe it took them 5 weeks to reply to my review and I included all this info in the review.\" My client attempted to post to my profile and did not hear back from Care for FIVE WEEKS. And then Care asked for information which my client had given in her original review.\n\nHere is another email a client sent to Care.com after trying for weeks to post a review,  \"I have sent you this REViEW- a half dozen times. I can\u2019t get my review posted. This is absurd.    I am Terry  M--- the  employer. I employed Jeanne G . You are welcome to call me, email me you can come visit my home. How can you have a site to review services if a customer cant post their reviews??? What do I need to do to get my review posted. \nTerry M----\"\n\nThat was October 2 -- more than TWO MONTHS AGO. The problem remains unfixed.\n\nMost of my clients have told me they have giving up trying to get a review posted -- they said they have NEVER received such bad customer service.\n\nI wouldn't trust them with my sensitive personal information."

Make sure to pay to have a background check done on you, it looks good and then people will know that you are trustworthy. Find good sources to give you references, if you have babysat or dog sat in the past ask the person if they would give you a review. Experience looks good. Talking about experience....try to get as much as you can, through family, friends....even by taking CPR, first aid and any other child related courses that could be helpful. Hope these helped, not sure if you have done any of them already."

	"text": "Welcome to our community! I suggest you put some times aside to really navigate on the desktop site to clearly set up your entire profile. Get 3 reviews from the people you know. Buy the premium it\u2019s $20/mo but since you are a beginner, I suggest you get the 6 months premium for $50 to really pop up on parents search list. Either way, you will still get the MOTOR VEHICLE RECORD CHECK for FREE (with the 6mo plan, you can update it at anytime as long as you are a premium member).  Background check is Almost the same price as the 6mo premium and the website only requires you to have at least one background check. If you can\u2019t afford all 3 (MVR, background & premium), then your best perk is the 6mo premium. Add a debit card on file and apply to at least 30 jobs in a day. Respond quickly to message. All of these will boost you more to have th e Carepro status. \nYou can look up some previous posts on how to enhance your biography it\u2019s usually the first key at declining applicants. It\u2019s based on your location, education, experiences, certifications and what you are willing to do on the job which can be factored into your hourly rate. Don\u2019t work for a salary and if you will be working for one family at a time as a nanny make sure they enroll you in Homepay on care to get you a W4 to fill out and then a W2 at the end of January so that you can do your taxes. Do not fill out the 1099 form and make sure you are earning at least the minimum hourly rate of your state! Be bold and get a contract too about your rate, being paid on time, on the book (no cash), late fee for cancellations, paid vacation or sick days.....\nDon\u2019t be discouraged to turn down parents that want to low ball you and stand up when they are taking advantage of you.\nLook up some previous you have all of your answers. Good luck !"

	"text": "Hi there.  You're not the only one frustrated.  I've seen a couple comments from other caregivers, too, saying they were not receiving communication BACK from people in need of caregivers.  I've been a member for several years.  I never had a problem until the last year.   I notice they want everyone to \"upgrade\" to be able to communicate with whomever you are trying to reach.  I have not done that and refuse to.  Also I think there are \"fake\" people looking for caregivers.  All the descriptions sound the same, the hours are the same, and when I send a message to 10 people, for example, I MIGHT hear from one person.   Oh and those particular \"adds\" also don't provide a picture.  That's not a coincidence.  I have great credentials, good experience, I am professional and I look like a professional.  So I know something is up when I don't hear from so many people.  I'm sure care.com will not like when they see these comments, but we have to speak out.  This used to be a great service.  I think it's an improvement that they want us to do a carecheck up front, though.  That shows you guys that we don't have any scary things in our background (there are other levels of background checks.)    Maybe if they hear from enough people something will change.

	"text": "Well, the first thing I did was scroll through the pictures and it was dog, dog, dog and I was like Awwwww, Cute! :) And then the last one caught me off guard. lololol So I am wondering if you did that intentionally first of all. Too funny!\n\nI definitely LOVE your main pic, but not sure if you want to have ALL your pictures also with an animal. Are there any kid options you can pull up.\n\nGreat job on being CPR and First Aid Certified! :)\n\nOo! How do you get an \"international driver's license\"? :) That sounds neat and interesting...or is that just a regular license but writing it fancy. lol Not sure here.\n\nI love love LOVE your excellent review. What a great start! I'm impressed. :)\n\nI also am really liking your paragraph. And if I'm not mistaken someoooone was doing a little character watching with her \"&\"s. Been there before. lol I LOVE the visuals you have provided in your paragraph. It really shows what you could possible doing with a potential families child.\n\nLOVE 10+ years and CPR and First Aid Certifications! Awesome.\n\nI actually really love your profile, Urszula! Top notch. I would say the only things that I can see possible improvements on currently would be your avg response rate could be waaaaayyyy better than <20 days. I would say to always shoot for within a few hours...if possible.\n\nBackground check and premium also would be GREAT additions. Background check helps with folks who might be narrowing their searches by only those who have background checks(along with the few people who would just require it as one of their criteria on profiles no matter what). But quite honestly this is the one case so far where I am like your review is pretty strong. I could definitely see someone bringing you in and then running the background check afterwards(although apparently that happens a lot) so background check is not the most crucial issue for you if looking for a long term position. If for babysitting though I think background checks are pretty crucial. Couple reasons.\n\nWith premium you could definitely capitalize on your awesome review. You could check out your stats of who has looked at your profile and be reaching out to families even if they don't have a current posting. Some families are actively looking but won't post it. A lot of caregivers do not capitalize on this feature. Definitely should give it a go.\n\nYour calendar isn't filled out at all. An updated calendar supposedly keeps you higher in searches. But it would also give folks an idea of your actually availability to work. It doesn't have to be accurate to those actually days, but just an idea of what type of schedule you are looking for. I think some families who might be looking at your profile may just not sure exactly what type of position you are looking for. So can definitely make a few changes to make that clearer so people aren't hesitant to reach out over that.\n\nSo are you getting any messages back currently? I'm curious. What types of things have you been replying to? Anyone reaching out to you? If so, what types of jobs did they have available?\n\nIf anything, I would definitely like for more of those 14 years of experience to be reflected in your reviews if possible. Definitely want to reach out to any past families. You've already done the hard part, not you just have to collect.\n\nI thiiiink that's it, Urszula! Let me know if you have any questions. :)"

I used care 2 different periods before now to find families. The first abt 4yrs ago was a bit slow mainly because I didn\u2019t have much free time. 2yrs ago I had fulltime availability and I think abt a total of 2 real people reached out to me but I went with a family I initially reached out to be their nanny. Recently I both the background checks and this week alone 10 people have reached out to me. I just started full time for a family that messaged me last week. I have been a bit more selective this time based from past experience and me wanted a full time family and it took 2 weeks, but I was willing to go longer if needed. The main piece of advice would be to be careful with your choice because you could miss the right family while your playing with the wrong one. -I didn\u2019t mean for it to be so long, but good luck in your search!"

They're working their way through all of the Care members, so look out for you email to know when it's your turn. \n\nIn case you don't know, the CareCheck background check is not the same as the Criminal+MVR background check. CareCheck is for Care's purposes, mainly to identity who you are and if you have any \n\"issues\" in your background that would prevent you from being a caregiver. The background check that you purchase will stay on your profile for 6 months and you will be able to share it with prospective employers. \nBest regards,\n\ud83d\ude0a Kelly K"

I completely understand this is a safety protector on cares part, but if that\u2019s the case why wouldn\u2019t it be for all parties using the app?\n\nLet\u2019s be real for a minute. MOST families want to meet at their house so you can see the kids, be introduced to the routines etc. And sadly the world today is a crazy place. Someone may sound totally great on the phone, but you just can never know. Many of us are woman. Personally, I\u2019m a young woman in my twenties and petite. Walking alone in the parking lot is an unsettling feeling for many of us in today\u2019s day which is sad. But this is even going to someone\u2019s home. Of course I take all the precautions like trying to find the family on Facebook, meet in the day, phone interview first, tell my boyfriend to call if he doesn\u2019t here from me within the hour. I know I probably sound dramatic and don\u2019t want to scare anyone, but we do take a risk meeting with families the first time. \n\nYes these people are leaving their children with us but many of us are going to THEIR homes. \n\nI just personally can\u2019t see why there wouldn\u2019t be any kind of protection on our end. Yeah, you can\u2019t get background checks for everyone in the house, but just something to verify the parent with the account is better than nothing. \n\nSorry just had to throw in my two cents. I\u2019m not comfortable putting my SSN or any personal info in over the internet. This has always been a preference of mine and a rule I live by. I don\u2019t want to sound hypocritical since I won\u2019t be doing it, I\u2019m just trying to say it\u2019s not any safer for us than it is for them so the requirements should not be different. \n\nI feel super disappointed that caregivers will be required to do this in order to use the app anymore, but still no protection on our behalf. We\u2019re required to, but there\u2019s not even an OPTION for us to request one from them."

Also, don\u2019t pay for background checks, let the family that\u2019s interested ask to run and pay for it. Chat through care, phone interview first, then possible in person. Never take money ahead of time, that\u2019s a scam, no one needs your personal info ever, unless you are ready to sign a contract and start working."

	"text": "I just posted this on another person's question, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to post it here too.\n\nI have been using care.com on and off for 3 years now and here are my suggestions:\n\n1. If you can pay for premium. It's kinda necessary for messaging, it boosts your stats, and you get a vehicle background check included in the price. Use the promo code CARESAVE for 20% off (I think?). I pay for 1 month at a time because if I get a job in that first month, I cancel my premium subscription. It does remove my background check, which is annoying, but I print it off to have in case my current family requests it.\n\n2. Make your application peppy and personal. Families want to see that you're excited to work with them. I start with \"Hello!\", add the phrase \"Here is a little bit more about me\" before diving into my credentials, and close it out with \"Your family sounds awesome and I would love the chance to work with you, even if it's just as a date night sitter!\" and always, always thank them for their time!\n\n3. Take an extra 5 minutes to personalize your application. Do they want someone with a car? If you have one say so! Do they want someone who can also tutor in math and you've helped kids with math before? Mention it! Half the time people are only looking at your application and not your profile, so list things like CPR training, skills, and whether or not you have a car. I have a base application saved and I add things specific to each application.\n\n4. Mention things other than childcare! They are bringing you into their family and want to know you! Talk about your hobbies. I mention that I like hiking, crafting, and science. It makes a huge difference and you seem like a more well-rounded person\n\nI hope this helps!"

However I would recommend getting ur first aid/CPR/AED training for infants, toddlers, school agers.  I would share with potential clients the age groups that you have actually cared for & any titles u may have had in the process.  For example I have been the girl next door babysitter, worked in church nurseries, nanny, mother's helper, before/after school daycare provider being a bus associate/monitor for a large school district back in Iowa.  Basically u need to sell urself.  If u r willing to do additional side jobs such as laundry, meal prep, lt housekeeping etc.  Have people write u reference letters as other families like to see these as well.  I hope this gives u some ideas to fill out ur resume.  One last thing, sometimes u don't get hardly any nibbles for jobs & then everything goes like gangbusters & u will have to turn people down.  Trust me, we all go through this roller coaster cycle.  Good luck on ur new career! \ud83d\ude0a"

It was easily 100+.\n\nYour care.com profile is a business bio so make it appear like one as you highlight skills, experience, certifications if applicable and the like while checking for spelling and grammar.  Your applications should have all of the above plus acknowledgements to specific details in job posting to show you have read what family is looking for.  For example, if they need someone MWF 8am-5pm, you mention that. Do you have any special skills that you can introduce that is unique and attractive?  I for example can speak Japanese and am a classically trained musician in two instruments: voice and piano.   Those kinds of qualities will not go unnoticed.\n\nThe other big scale tippers are having a background check (Criminal +MVR) that you can share with families along with application by clicking a checkbox and references/reviews.  In what capacity have you worked with kids before and can those families write a review or agree to having their contact info shared with potential new family?\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many applications you\u2019ll send before getting a response but persistence will prevail.

You should definitely lead with you've been a professional nanny for 20 years rather than the part about being a mother too(although that is of course important in life). Parents want to know what your experience is with other people's children.\n\nPlease change your profile picture. To something smiling would be the preference and not in the ambiance of your vehicle. You look a little worried in this particular picture.\n\nI think with 20 years of experience as a nanny, we need to see more of that reflected in your reviews. Even the nanny family that did take the time to review, it was rather bland. So if you have any other families that can leave you a more thorough review that would be great. If not, you can always take the avenue of taking on many one-time gigs with the sole goal of acquiring STELLAR 5-star reviews, which means go above and beyond.\n\nYour avg response rate is pretty decent. But it has room to come down some more to <4 hours or <2 hours if possible.\n\nLastly, I'm not sure if there's anything you can do about it saying \"some college\", but if possible to remove that, that would be great. It highlights that you didn't finish.\n\nOkay, Jennifer. Think that's it. Let me know if you have any questions. :)"

Even if you don\u2019t think you fit the criteria of the job, apply anyways. A lot of times the employers don\u2019t put down everything or they just put the basic of what Care.com allows them to do. Also make sure that you get back to the people that reply back even if you\u2019re not interested. Care.com registers that if you get back to people right away,  if you have a Care.com badge on your profile,  if you have a criminal background check. All these things are important because the more that you have and also reviews are important as well. Care.com allows you to send a link to the people that you work for and you can kindly ask them to send you a review. When you meet all the criteria ifor Care.Com, your people will be put closer to the top, that means they will also send your profile to potential employers as well. I have three nanny jobs each job is about two days apiece,  if I leave one job I can get one within l a week.  I have no issues getting jobs from the site. Ask me any question do you like.."

Most don't want smoking around their children.\nDo you have a picture? Parents want to see the person that will be watching their kids.

	"text": "I copied and pasted this from another post that I responded to a few days ago......\n\nI\u2019m sorry but every time I see a post along these lines, it amazes.....astounds.....even somewhat confuses me that those that are new seem to think that if they apply for 20, 30, even 50 jobs......that they will get massive responses. This site does NOT guarantee anyone a job. They are the middle man, the intermediary, the go between.....helping those seeking childcare connect with those who are looking for a childcare position and visa versa. If you are young and have little to no experience, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to find a job. If you are a college student who can only work certain days & certain hours and that changes with each semester, it\u2019s going to be difficult to find a position. Yes, I applaud you for your hard work & dedication in getting your education, but the majority of families are looking for someone full time or part time with set days & hours.\nIf I\u2019ve said it once, I\u2019ve said it a hundred times.....you can apply to one hundred jobs and beyond that with the exception of a follow up message (thanking the family from accepting your application and that you look forward to hearing from them soon) there is absolutely nothing you can do. A family listing a job may get dozens of responses. They may or may not read all of them. They may skim through and pick just a few. If you are not among the chosen few, do not expect any kind of acknowledgement. In over 2.5 years and the dozens of applicants that I have put out, I have received TWO responses that basically said \u201cthank you for your application, but we have decided to go in a different direction\u201d. One of you must have premium in order for messages to go back & forth. I see so many caregivers say \u201cI\u2019m no paying for premium. I\u2019m not paying for a background check. Those are the responsibility of the employer,\u201d Did you ever stop to think the potential employers are waiting for applications thinking \u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility to get premium or pay for a background check, if they want a job badly enough they will pay for it.\u201d Did anyone ever think of that? And if they want a background background check on every person that they interview, even four interviews add up to over $100. If one is hired, $75 down the drain. If no one is hired $100 gone for nothing. No one seems to want to look at both sides of the coin....job seekers OR potential employers.\nYou can have what you believe to be the best references, experience and application.....and you can stand on your head and sing Mary had a Little Lamb until pigs fly, but there is absolutely nothing that you can do to make anyone respond to your application, in any way-shape-or form.\nI have applied to a job, only to see the post vanish within hours. I (right now) have an application \u201copen\u201d that I sent out March 20th for a position that was to begin October 1st. The job is still showing as open. I would put money on they have hired someone and never closed the position. I have one that I applied for May 21st also to begin October 1st, I\u2019d bet the same happened with this one. I wish there was some way that we as caregivers could \u201cclean\u201d out our applications after say 3 to 6 months. There are problems with the site. The site is also a great tool and resource, but they make no guarantees and are not miracle workers.\nStepping down from my soapbox now........."

I am new here just a month in, and I thought I found my perfect job right away from someone who was also new. Anyways I started watching his 2 huskies 3 weeks ago. The 1st week he paid me on Friday exactly what he promised. The 2nd Friday he said he gets paid biweekly, so I'm like ok that's fine. I watched them the following week, than by Friday he messaged me he's calling in sick 2 work. I messaged him all weekend about getting pd than Monday he doesn't drop his dogs off, and he's ghosting me not responding 2 any text. I'm not sure what 2 do. \n\nThe worse part besides him not paying me is his dogs where really bad not trained at all  They went potty all over my house, they would get on the counters, get into everything and attack my dogs for no reason. They where really hyper, didn't want to ever go outside 2 play or go potty. Than there is the fact that 1 week he basically had me watch them 24 hours a day because he supposedly was moving. He never brought food so I supplied food and treats. Than he even had 1 of the dogs fixed so I watched her through that meds and trying not 2 let her play. \n\nI'm really bummed my first job here and I'm going through this. I paid the membership and for a background check. What about the people that r doing the hiring shouldn't they have some sort of background check. I dont even know this guys last name address or if he even used his real name. How r we protected from people like this. If anyone has any advise I'd appreciate it thanks\n\nKelly"

None of the families I've interviewed with said, \"wow, I'm impressed with your CarePro status.\"\ud83d\ude03 I've never had a problem finding a job through Care. I do think it's important to have a good bio and a completed profile. Also, reviews are very helpful as they can show the families a bit about your character, how well you work with children, and your work ethic. You can ask past employers, family, and friends to post reviews for you. I've never purchased a background check, because if a prospective employer asks if I'm willing to do a background check, they can request the background check through Care and that will be their expense, not mine. Have an excellent bio, CPR/First Aid certification, reviews, references/letters of recommendation, and you should be able to find a position. Be patient. It often takes the families quite awhile to sort through many applications and get back to you, if they get back to you. Apply to as many jobs as you can, all that fit your needs and schedule. So, getting back to your original question. I would say it's been a 1 for me, but for others it might be a 10. Good luck! \ud83d\ude0a"

But definitely don't rely on people finding you even if you pop up at the top of the lists. Keep applying to as many postings as you can. I'm guessing a lot of families don't even do searches- they are very busy and probably just read the applications as they receive them. \nI got a job without a premium membership. I also didn't pay for any background checks.  I put on my applications that I was willing to undergo background and MVR checks.

I found a few You Tube videos where others shared that the jobs came in after they upgraded and added the background check. Before this they were not getting interviews. So I did what they did. If you don't have the money then save up or go take another job and save the money. If you can't find the small amount they ask then I wonder how you will get gas to get to work. Usually they don't pay until after a week or two. I truly not trying to upset anyone. I'm just sharing what I researched and speaking from. My own experience. Good luck to everyone. I did have one family pay for the background check on me. I only had to grant them permission. Good luck to everyone."

I\u2019ve experienced most of what some people stated families who doesn\u2019t appreciate the work you do for the patient ( but most of times the patient does because it\u2019s direct care). Sister Lailatou you are so right \ud83d\udc4dI strongly believe that caregivers have to stand for themselves if not no one will ! Thank you for lifting our spirit as caregivers.The other thing is question of luck ! I got to work with wonderful families and am still friends with them after my clients passing. \nAbout Care.com I happened to have background check just 4 months but every time I send an application I get the message saying background check is due and do not any replies. This is a wonderful website to find a job even though I am paying the premium l still feel left out like some other members ! Are jobs being held ? For the first time I\u2019ve been looking for 2 months now no success. Thank you all for your inputs ! Happy holidays"

The point of asking people how they feel is to see people\u2019s different perspectives. If you just want to argue every person who says they have no problem with it, then why ask how people feel?? It\u2019s mean to set them up like that. If you all you wanted was responses that agreed with you, maybe you should\u2019ve worded the question differently. \nAlso... just because people are telling you to stick it out, doesn\u2019t mean you have to. You have to make your own choices. If you\u2019re miserable, then move on. Jobs that don\u2019t require background checks are slim in my experience, but I wish you the best in finding one that makes you happy."

They can't see your application unless they are Premium members themselves, and if they are, yours will be buried too deep for them to bother looking at it.  I can tell that right now there are only a fraction of the jobs that would normally be posted, and presumably more people than ever are looking for work. If you want to find a job here, Premium membership is a must. Background check is a must. So is CPR certification. Everyone is looking for a nanny gig, but consider branching out and applying for a special needs position. You are much more likely to get a response. Also if you can afford it, consider taking a CNA course. It only takes a few weeks and it will help you stand out from the crowd.  \n\nFrom now on, no matter how desperate I am, I will not work for an employer who wants to pay me under the table. I want verifiable income so I can get unemployment benefits and ACA coverage. We are professionals, and we need to start insisting on being treated as such."

A representative at Care.com said that unless the other family has upgraded to premium or I have,  they cannot contact me. So either the family has to upgrade or you have to upgrade for them to be able to respond to you. I thought that was a bit of false advertising, to call it a \u201cfree\u201d service when, unless you upgrade, you rarely hear back from any families you\u2019ve applied to. I have applied to 40 families at a time with no answers, until I upgraded to premium. And I have a Masters degree in education, a lot of teaching experience and 2 1/2 years of Nanny experience so it\u2019s not that I\u2019m not qualified. Once I upgraded to premium, I got way more responses. I just purchased one month of premium  at a time.  Also, you really  do you need to have a background check to help you with your job search. And maybe ask someone to read your profile to see if it sounds good. That\u2019s what I did. Hope that helps."

	"text": "Hi Heidi, I've been using Care.com for almost 10 years now, and when properly managed can be a great resource in finding work. As far as the initial contact is concerned, I generally would set up and hold a phone interview first and then if that goes well and both sides agree to move forward is when you can set up your \"face to face\" interview, which generally will take place within a few days of the initial contact. You will find some families will prefer you coming to their home to do the interview, others might prefer a neutral location like a coffee shop, restaurant, etc. I myself have never had a bad experience using this site, but I would do my due diligence prior to a meeting just as a precaution. For example, google the address they provide and any names they give you, most of the time nothing alarming will present itself but it's always best to check anyways. NEVER give any of your personal information to a potential employer until after you have met them and they are considering hiring you and need to run background checks or verify you in general. I hope this helps, and good luck in your search, I have no doubt you'll find something very soon!!"

The Criminal+MVR background checks that you or a prospective employer purchases are stored on your profile. A prospective employer can request to view it and you will need to grant them access to it. Also, keep in mind that Trustline background checks are not as thorough as the background checks on Care. Trustline only searches statewide. The company that does the Care background checks search nationwide. Some families prefer a more thorough background check. Every family is different. It's not mandatory for you to purchase an background check. I had a family request a background check and they paid for it, actually the company that the father worked for paid for it. If the family wants it, you can let them incur the expense. The background check will stay on your profile and expire after 6 months. Good luck to you!"

As a mother, I would want a background check on you as I am leaving you alone in my house all day, with my personal things, personal information,  and my child.    No mom will hire you without one, plus 3 work references where you have cared for a child longer than six months  consistently.  Borrow the money to get the basic background check.  Parents can purchase a more extensive criminal background check also if they want to.  If you are driving their children, they may also want a license or driving check too.  I gather all past employers, work history, education, certificates that you may have like CPR, first aid, etc. and make copies and put that in your resume packet.  A list of 3 current references are also needed.  Personal Letters of Recommendation look great and that is what gets the jobs too.  If you think this is too much, then look elsewhere for employment.  The YMCA also hires teachers for their  summer camps and sitter service for their members.  YMCA has an extensive hiring, reference and interview process,  which is unbelievable for the Y and you are always around your co-workers and personnel, not alone with kids, so don't be shocked on what is required to be a Nanny.

Probably you can try to talk to somebody else and convince to grant you access to the site till your ALREADY PAID background check will expire? This situation is extremely frustrating with unfairness! Asking caregivers to pay without offering any additional value? They even took down the CareChat that offer at least some privacy to both sides before they figure out if it is a good match"

	"text": "I applied to this mans Senior caregiving ad in  October. His name is Kevin Beechwood. The ad said care for his mother. \nI gave my cell. He called, seemed nice, he said he needed an overnight fill-in for 4 specific days for his aunt. He was paying $275 a 15 hour shift. He said hold those days. Which I did. \nWe met shortly after at a Panera for an interview. He was dressed nice, geeky, in his late 30s, had brief case, laptop, seemed all in order,...in very beginning of interview he asked my address, so he could Mapquest the distance to his AUNT.  Then shortly after asks for my ssn so he could do his own background check. I stupidly gave him both, because I really needed this \u201cjob\u201d? \nHe said he\u2019d be in touch to confirm things. He stayed in touch, but then cancelled on that job, and just kept saying he wasn\u2019t sure, he needed to figure things out, he liked My personality, maybe I would be a better fit for his parents? So he continues to stay in touch, stringing me along, then flaking on what was discussed each time. Over a period of 3 1/2 mos., over 10 calls. And I\u2019m stressing about him knowing my address & ssn. So many Red flags, that I ignored. So he calls just recently, says he\u2019s ready to introduce me to his parents & get started. The day of, I ever heard anything previous as to an address. \nHe calls & puts me off again. More excuses. I got extremely frustrated & was brutally honest about all of it. I texted him just please leave me alone, I\u2019m tired of this game. Etc., etc. That Care.com said a person should only ask these questions after you are hired, with a contract, etc. He texts me and is very defensive, says he\u2019s a college professor, he\u2019s just busy, etc. etc. That he did nothing with my personal information.  A terrible lesson learned, and I\u2019m still freaking out about him doing something bad. Has anyone else in senior care ever encountered or answered this man for his posting? \nOr actually worked for him? Or had a similar situation? Please lmk! I\u2019m so upset & feel so stupid."

I get asked about my college classes and degrees, why I want to nanny, where I live/am from, just things like that.\n\nAsk them questions as well about the child/children. Ask about any allergies, routines, any favorite games or shows, if they're even allowed to use ipads/watch tv, toys they like to play with, favorite foods. If it's a baby ask about the nap routine (times they nap and how they nap such as with noisemakers or with a binky). Also ask about the baby's feeding routine, if they steam the baby's bottles, things like that. If the pay rate is brought up be honest of what you are looking for once you go over what they expect of you. Also bring up vacation time, sick days, and holidays. Get all of your questions answered, you're interviewing them as well."

No one real will pay you before you watch their kids. That\u2019s the most important part.. Is your profile filled out completely and you\u2019ve written a little about yourself? Does your pay match your experience? When you apply are you still telling people more about yourself and relating it to their needs? If you\u2019re doing all of that just keep doing it and eventually you\u2019ll get some responses. Oh and some people won\u2019t respond because their on the free membership which means they can only see responses or reply to caregivers who are on a paid membership. You can check this out by clicking on your messages to each of them and seeing if you can read the message you sent or if it\u2019s all blurred out which means it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll respond because they\u2019re taking the cheaper route. I\u2019m paying for the background check and for courses to help on the job. I don\u2019t think caregivers should have to pay for a membership so when I notice I\u2019ve replied to one like that I just figure they wouldn\u2019t have really paid as high as they said because they didn\u2019t even pay for their own ad."

	"text": "It's not a problem if you do the background check on care.com yourself.  I done mine and kept it up to date since I been with care.com--just over two years.  When I get mine, I print out a copy for any family that I am going to interview with.  It does NOT show  your entire SS# or your entire birth date.  Filling out an application is a different matter altogether.  I have not had any family ask me to fill out an application, maybe it's the area that I live in, but I find that concept rather bizarre.  My profile is always up to date and complete.  My reviews are also up to date.  I also have reference letters from all of my families to copy and take to interviews with me. I also take copies of my CPR certificate and my background check to an interview. The more that  you have your \"stuff\" together, the more organized you are and the less the potential employer has to do ....... the better impression it makes.  I have been complimented by more one family on my organization, having all of my information ready for them and saving them time.  When you have everything together and ready it makes a good impression and it will also answer a lot of questions for the family---that they would have normally covered in the interview. As a result, my interviews really turn out to be a meeting of them making sure I am who I present myself to be in my profile, and getting to know one another a bit.  Because of this most of my positions have been offered to me the very same day (within just a two to four hour time period).  I even had one short term position that the Mom had already hired me in her mind before I even met her.  They even gave me a $5 an hour increase after my first week!! :)"

I do want to mention that your bio is one of the best put together bios that I have seen thus far! :)\n\nCPR and First Aid trained, background checked, premium. All EXCELLENT!\n\nI like that you started on gathering reviews. However, that person Lauren is really throwing a wrench into this situation. If anything my suggestion for you would be to try as hard as possible to book one-time gigs just with the pure goal in mind of collecting 5 star reviews to combat this. Otherwise, parents might just bypass your profile because there are too many options who have 5 stars overall.\n\nSome other things that would help this situation would be to fill out your availability calendar. It supposedly keeps you higher in searches when it is filled out. But also if you could fill it out with the ideal days that you would like to cover that would be great too. Sometimes people will just bypass your profile if they can't get a quick answer of what days/times you would be able to cover.\n\nThe only thing that I see can maybe be improved with your bio as it is now is to change up how you begin your sentences, instead of having them all begin with \"I\". It will likely flow more easily.\n\nYour work history also says that your last position ended in 2017. So if you could get some updated families and reviews that would be great. But also, it says that you nannied for over 10 years and can provide references. If you can get that to start showing through your reviews that would also be wonderful. At least one in depth review from someone you had a longer term relationship with would help, since those are the families that you are trying to reach right now, long-term. And that currently is not reflected in your reviews at all.\n\nOkay. That's the gist! Sorry for the delay. Let me know if you have any questions, Cathy. :)"

I figure I want to work for someone who can take the time to compose at least a few sentences about the care of their child! Similarly, I don't just copy and paste my job applications. I write directly to the specific family. If they mention their toddler is hard to understand, I assure them I speak fluent toddler. If they say they'd like a nanny who goes above and beyond, I explain that Mary Poppins is my spirit animal. I am also specific about my experience. If they have a 2 year old, I tell them how I love to read and sing and make trains out of cardboard boxes. If they need someone to help with homework, I mention the 13-year-old kid with dyslexia and ADHD I've tutored, or the 6 year old whose phonics lessons are usually concealed  in games and art. \nI also list pertinent qualifications or abilities with fun words and tidbits of info to give them an idea of who I am: \"I love to cook (homemade calzones, anyone?), I play the piano and psaltery, I thoroughly enjoy swimming, and have my own dependable transportation.\"\nPromote yourself, know your worth, and give details in your application. I don't ever do the background check, but I say that I am totally comfortable with it. Also explain that you will give references after further communication.\nI think I have as many pictures as they'll let you add.

Either way, have the parents send you an interview request or /and a booking request through the site that you can confirm by accepting them and share with a trusted person just in case."

I am CPR & First Aid Certified, I have a BA and MA in Forensic Psychology, and I am a certified Behavioral Assistant! I have worked in childcare for about 7 years with children ranging in age from 3-months up to 16-years-old. I like to consider myself to be a very caring, trustworthy, timely, and patient person and hope to showcase those characteristics while working with you. I do have my own vehicle, and I am pet-friendly as well as open to doing light-housework if needed! Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\"\n\nThat about covers everything about me that is needed to be well informed about my childcare experience and what I bring to the table. I usually add in a snippet of something personal that the parents mentioned in their ad. Something like, if the parents mention wanting their kids to play outside more, I express my abilities to creatively engage kids of any age in fun outdoor games and activities. I hope this helps!!"

Today 98-99% of people have no common courtesy and lack even basic common sense. I have three applications outstanding, dating back to late April. The position for each one is still showing as open. Two have been read, one still just says delivered. One of those that were read actually looked at my profile. They have each received my initial application and a follow up email from me, but still all I hear are crickets when it comes to those applications. Long story short.....once you have sent your application there is nothing you can do but wait.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been with care.com for just over two years. Every job I have found has been through them, with the exception of one. I have worked for six great families. Each had different needs as far as childcare. All were short term\u2014the shortest 6 weeks the longest being almost 7 months. I specialize in newborn and infant care. All have been first time parents except one. They are either looking someone to care for their new baby until their daycare spot opens up, or until the baby is a certain age and then they go into daycare, and one family I cared for their newborn for about 3 months while the mom was ending her time in the military and going through whatever it takes for processing out. I am at premium status because I feel that little bit of investment in myself has paid for itself.i also keep my background check and MVR report up to date, I also believe that helps in getting hired\u2014- by having it in hand when applying for a job.\n\nJust know that you are definitely not the only one."

So yes, it\u2019s an automatic payment. They have to charge the card before they do the background check. In order for your background and motor vehicle checks to go through, you have to follow the steps from Sterling. Did you fill out that form already? If yes, you should have gotten an email from Care that your background check results are ready and you can view them. Did you receive anything like that? Check your spam and social folders, or search for \u201cbackground check\u201d in your inbox. If you don\u2019t see anything like that, email careteam@care.com to see what the problem is.

I think it\u2019s okay to pay for a background check if you are doing date night jobs, one-time gigs, etc. But if you\u2019re looking for a full-time position, you shouldn\u2019t have to pay for your own background check. No other industry would you have to pay for your own check. If you go through an agency, the agency pays for it with the money they get from the families. If a family thinks I don\u2019t want it badly enough because I won\u2019t pay for premium or my own check, then they clearly don\u2019t respect that not everyone has extra money laying around, and I wouldn\u2019t want to work for them anyway. If a family needing regular care can\u2019t afford to pay for premium and a couple background checks, then they have no business hiring a nanny who they will be needing to pay appropriately and consistently. \nEverything else you said, though, I pretty much agree with. It takes time and a lot of hard work and persistence. Busy families don\u2019t always have time to reach out to every applicant to let them know the went with a different applicant or remember to take down the job opening.

It\u2019s limited messaging if you don\u2019t or the family doesn\u2019t. I personally got premium just so I never run into the last problem and I signed up a week ago.

Hopefully the mark as hired feature is actually working now, so that whoever hires you that \"work history\" will give you a more recent date. When a family sees that they will most likely be thinking \"what? 2014\" but they don't realize that what is on care is not always everything to your experience and story as care is limited.\n\nYou have 2 years experience? Is that accurate and reflective of your complete childcare experience? Just checking.\n\nAwesome job on having a background check, Shatecia and being CPR/First Aid Certified! And possibly think about going premium if you are actively searching.\n\nGreat job at having reviews on your profile. The next step is to have reviews from folks that you have actually done childcare. When a family is reading it, they want to picture what it would be like to have you in the role.\n\nYour schedule lists a lot of availability. But your profile says full-time \"babysitter\". Are you looking for a babysitting gigs or a full-time nanny role. I would definitely fix your profile accordingly whether that's on your availability calendar or the title at the top.\n\nI know the ladies helped you with your bio a few times, I actually never got a chance to look at it.

If her family had recognized it more and gotten her some help it may have helped prevent such a horrible thing from happening.\n\nI believe the majority of the cases you\u2019ve listed there probably had to do with mental illness such as can be brought on from postpartum depression and quite often the results of the life of drugs and debauchery.\n\nAs far as background checking the parents go, They are technically going to be employers and unfortunately we don\u2019t get a background check employers or even a business that we may potentially work for. You may be able to do a little research on your own, which I generally do before I accept the job. If your family sends up red flags to you that they may be nuts, don\u2019t accept the job. And in case you didn\u2019t realize, most of the cases you listed are people who had no previous serious criminal records. And with HIPPAA laws, there\u2019s no way for us to know nowadays if someone\u2019s mentally ill other than being aware and alert to signs. We need to use caution every day in every venture with anyone we come in contact with. The reality is, you\u2019re much more apt to be murdered by a \u201cloved one\u201d than your employer or a stranger."

You just have to take precautions just like with anything else, don't post your number nor email on your bio (you can but shouldn't) there's a chat and phone feature within the app, if you land an interview always meet in a public place e.g cafe, playground or take someone with you. Have two nice photos of you smiling on your profile, set a good rate for yourself depending on your experience (don't sell yourself short but also be mindful) get a background check and try to get a few family members, friends, even teachers to write you a review. Get at least 2 references and write a separate paragraph for your application (that is what you send when applying to jobs). Don't get discouraged. Good Luck!"

Are you from Indiana, or is he claiming that he is moving to your area from Indiana? A common red flag is when they are \u201cabout to be moving to your area\u201d. Working a shift the same day doesn\u2019t seem too odd if it\u2019s a trial type of thing. I have done trial babysitting right after some interviews so that the parents can see that you click well with the children, and I am paid for it. I wouldn\u2019t accept a personal check from somebody on the first payment, just cash. I think you made the right move! Always better safe than sorry!!"

Make sure you ask them for reviews that's the reason I get plenty of clients. You can even give them $5 off for next cleaning for a kind review I mean anything helps it's a business so you can market how ever you'd like.  Do not stop sending in applications. Do not give too many details say your name, years of experience and what you offer. If you give too many details they mostly likely will not read. Hope this helps."

	"text": "Come on now, think about what you\u2019re saying.... Who in their right mind will hire a pregnant nanny who will need to leave for maternity leave in 90 days, for 90 days. Meaning they have to nanny hunt again in 90 days, preform background checks again in 90 days, pay three more additional  months to have the access to nannies through Care.com or other agencies, which would more than double the cost of their Nanny hunt, right after their children have bonded with you.  What if there are complications, what if you are put on bed rest, what if you can\u2019t keep up with the kids, what if your child comes early? And then there\u2019s always the chance that you won\u2019t return after maternity leave, and if you do, what will you do with your baby? Some families don\u2019t want the liability, and expense of a nanny bringing her baby to work, nor should they be made to feel bad about not wanting the extra drama coming along with a new nanny. What if you have a  colicky baby who keeps their children from napping, what if their kid accidentally hurts yours, what if yours hurts theirs, what if their kids are sick, what if yours is sick, what about their pets around your baby, will all the car seats fit in your backseat, will their children get the 100% care that they are paying for?  See... just too much. \n\nIt\u2019s not just childcare seekers who are weary of hiring a pregnant woman in her third trimester, it\u2019s everyone because It\u2019s an unnecessary expense, you are now paying unemployment for an employee who isn\u2019t there and full wages for a fill in employee. I could understand if you\u2019ve been on your job for over a year and then get pregnant, but this is completely different and everyone has bills to pay and no one is obligated to hire us just because we need to eat. This is business, this is a trade, and the best woman for the job with the right skin hue usually wins, or lately the cheapest woman for the job, but definitely not the one who needs to eat or feed her baby the most. Keep trying, but be aware that you will most likely be hired after you\u2019ve  completed your 90 day maternity break."

Sometimes it's the stress and process they go through to hire a nanny. Sometimes they're just rude. It's always better to witness the family's character and the way they treat you from the very beginning. In most cases the way they present themselves in messages, on the phone, in-person is indicative as to how they will be in the future. Every family is different. I hope you hang in there and push through the rudeness. \nAs far as your background check, you don't need to grant anyone access to your background check  until you're ready. I don't usually grant access unless I'm serious about moving forward with the family. In the past, I've done the phone interview, then an in-person interview, then we'll discuss viewing my background check, providing immunization records, and any certificates they would like to see. The only families who I feel are entitled to see all of my paperwork are those families who I would like to move forward with. If they ask for anything from the the beginning of our communication, I usually tell them that after we meet and both of us agree that we might be a good fit and move forward with a contract, then I will grant them access to my background check and provide all of the paperwork they would like to see. I usually present the families with my letters of recommendation and references during an in-person interview. This is just how I've done things. I realize I've gone way off track, but I hope something I've said will help you. You stay in control of the process and don't give up. There are so many families that need a wonderful nanny. I believe you will find the right family. \ud83d\ude0aKelly"

You can try excepting a lower rate because you don\u2019t have a car. Do you have someone to take you to and from families or are you needing the family to provide transportation? Either way, I would recommend that you just apply for babysitting gigs until you get a car. Usually parents won\u2019t need you to take the children anywhere while just babysitting. I was once in your situation. I was thirteen and families had no problem picking me up and bringing me home.

I've never heard of that before far as the client going too pay background check. Hopefully there are honest with you. You probably should email her and find out whats up.. If she answers you back..... You got too be careful. Theys so many scams out there. I've been with care.com since 2016. And the latest 1 the other day I have an profile on carelinx.com. A woman send me an message said right off the bat I would like too hire... That's a (RED FLAG) then goes on too say her mother is wheelchair bound will pay me $25.00 an hour. Asked for my social security number, address, phone number. I'd replied back and said your not getting all that information. She said she needed she would send $600.00 so i could pick up that. So I said no... Then I'd already new it was a scam, and i went too say I'd like too meet you and your Mom.. And she never answered me back. I'd said SO....... So id called CareLinx.com and told them about this women. They took care of it. So if you get a message like I'd just received or they want you too get a prepaid card so you can buy there groceries and such and moving from another state. Do not fall in to the trap... And also be very careful meeting someone at there home even if they have kids. Bring someone with you or meet in public place... Sorry too say people or not honest anymore... if you feel something in your gut that is wrong just don't do it.... Be careful and safe.... P.S. About that background check you probably should get with Credit Bureau and tell them what happened... Take care!"

	"text": "Came across an issue yesterday with the family I nanny for.  I watch their 4 month old son 2 days a week from 7a-5p.  They trusted me because of all my certifications, background checks, and I\u2019m a mom already.  So I\u2019m watching the baby yesterday and down on the floor for tummy time with little man.  I know all doors are locked and secure.  Well all of a sudden, stomping up the front stairs, keys in the door(no knock or ring of the doorbell), in comes a woman that I don\u2019t know.  Didn\u2019t get a text/call from the parents to say who was coming over.  I ask the lady who she was because I was already spooked and I\u2019m in fight mode to protect the baby.  She got short and snippy saying I\u2019m his grandmother.  Ok still don\u2019t know you but I\u2019m going to have to trust your word a little since you came in with a key.  I text the parents and say grandma came over.   She was there for a matter of 5-10 mins and gone.  Just after I text to say she left, I get a response back from the dad...\u201dmy bad I meant to call you.  She called me saying she was going to stop by\u201d.  I\u2019m beyond upset at that point.  Don\u2019t brush off the safety of your son.  It happened the week prior with the dad\u2019s brother coming by but I at least got a text from the mom saying he was coming over just as he walked in the door(same way, key entry but no knock or doorbell ring) and the brother was super apologetic and immediately introduced himself and was using very specific names.   I voiced my concerns to the parents in our text about how it\u2019s a huge red flag safety issue with people storming the door and barging in unannounced.  I told them to give them my number to text and let me know directly instead of having to relay messages while they\u2019re at work.  Yes I have some hand to hand combat training and well as some informal training from my partner who\u2019s a retired infantry Marine.  So I\u2019m not worried there about self defense and protecting their child.  But where do I draw the line?  I had the plan to take a table lamp to the brother\u2019s head and damn near hurdled the sofa to get after the grandma to protect a child that isn\u2019t even mine?  Beyond voicing my concerns and telling them it\u2019s a hard no of people coming over unannounced and disrespectfully letting themselves into the house while they\u2019re not home, what else can I do beyond quitting?  I don\u2019t want to get physical with people because I literally do not know anyone in their family.  Any other advice?"

I was contacted and ask to send my care clientele list over to them, which I did. I was then contacted by Brittany to set up an interview and was sent a list of items needed before the interview which included a copy of my drivers license, my social security card and a form to fill out to do a background check.  Not willing to turn over that information, I was told the only way I could do the interview was to provide that information. I did research on the company and they exist in 4 other states as well are on LinkedIn.  A ref flag for me is why would this 95 year old women with Dementia,  living in Richmond, VA.  reach out to an agency in West Palm Beach, FL. to find help?  They were not accredited with the BBB, so as you know, no information, NO interview.

Background checked AND premium? Superb! So your bio definitely states that you have experience, but I'd love to lead your bio with more of what your actual duties as a nanny have been. You sound wonderful as a human being on the rise, but I would like less focus to be on your other things and more towards selling your experience and why a family should choose you to be their nanny. The way it stands now it makes it seem like you're just trying to grab some quick cash and can ditch the family for your dreams, which it's awesome to have goals, but families might be less committal if you leaving is on the forefront of everyone's mind, you know?\n\nYour profile also says \"cared for 0 families\" which I always just don't like because it reads horribly so hopefully you will be able to resolve that if even just 1 family gets added.\n\nSo after you fix your bio and get CPR and First Aid Trained, I think it would actually be great for you to reach out to some of your \"stats\" families. Families who have viewed your profile. See what kind of feedback you may be able to gather as to why they may not have messaged you and work from there.\n\n\nI think that's it, Izabellah!

I have 3 years of experience, but haven't tutored at a center in a while, and instead have been helping one family. I really enjoy tutoring though and find that I learn A LOT from students too! Any advice you all have would be welcomed--I've paid for premium because the benefits seem useful, and also bought a background check, but looking through the posts now I kind of wish I didn't. \n\nBasically I had been hired for a new job right before everything with COVID-19 started... which won't be able to start up, at this point, until July or August. So I've decided to pursue tutoring for now, and it's something I really enjoy, so I think it will be good... \n\nAny general advice/what you wish you had known welcomed."

I never had nannying or babysitting as my main job. Just weekends and in the summers. I am not getting enough hours at my current job and need a change. I have had troubles with bad work environments in the past so it was VERY hard for me to think of a part-time job i wouldn't absolutely dread. I know all jobs have their bad parts but i dont want to be miserable everyday just to make some money. I then thought about nannying. I downloaded 2 child care apps, this one and another. I made my profile, paid for background check and started looking. The more i read the descriptions of families needing after school nannies the more i was excited. A job that would fit well with my class schedule and pay well! I have applied for about 5 jobs and heard back from 4! Now that i have talked to a couple on the phone and started thinking about what day-to-day would be like the more i started doubting my self. I know i'm good with kids, i know i enjoy being around them but would i be good at nannying? Am i too young? Why would a parent trust ME? I am quite a paranoid/anxious person so i realize these are mostly irrational thoughts, but... are they?"

	"text": "I copied the majority of this when I responded to basically the same question a few days ago. Apparently some thought I was too harsh, truth is I was telling it how it is......still am, just going to soften it up some. \n\nThis site does NOT guarantee anyone a job. They are the middle man, the intermediary, the go between.....helping those seeking childcare connect with those who are looking for a childcare position and visa versa. If you are young and have little to no experience, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to find a job. If you are a college student who can only work certain days & certain hours and that changes with each semester, it\u2019s going to be difficult to find a position. Yes, I applaud you for your hard work & dedication in getting your education, but the majority of families are looking for someone full time or part time with set days & hours.\n\nYou can apply to one hundred jobs and beyond applying with the exception of a follow up message (thanking the family for accepting your application and that you look forward to hearing from them soon) there is absolutely nothing you can do. A family listing a job may get dozens of responses. They may or may not read all of them. They may skim through and pick just a few. If you are not among the chosen few, do not expect any kind of acknowledgement. In over 2.5 years and the dozens of applications that I have put out, I have received TWO responses that basically said \u201cthank you for your application, but we have decided to go in a different direction\u201d. One of you must have premium in order for messages to go back & forth. I see so many caregivers say \u201cI\u2019m no paying for premium. I\u2019m not paying for a background check. Those are the responsibility of the employer,\u201d Please look at it from the other side,  stop to think the potential employers are waiting for applications thinking \u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility to get premium or pay for a background check, if they want a job badly enough they will pay for it.\u201d  And if they want a background background check on every person that they interview, even four interviews add up to over $100. If one is hired, $75 down the drain. If no one is hired $100 gone for nothing. No one seems to want to look at both sides of the coin....job seekers OR potential employers.\n\nYou can have what you believe to be the best references, experience and application.....and you can stand on your head and sing Mary had a Little Lamb until pigs fly, but there is absolutely nothing that you can do to make anyone respond to your application, in any way-shape-or form.\n\nIf you get a response and an interview, then are offered the job....please please do NOT accept the position: if it doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel\u201d right, if you get to the interview and suddenly the number of hours & hourly rate are significantly reduced, if the job is just too far (one way or round trip)\u2014you don\u2019t get paid to drive to & from work. If you REALLY REALLY WANT the position, request mileage reimbursement, $0.58 per mile per IRS and get in writing. \n\nI have applied to a job, only to see the post vanish within hours. Until a few days ago, I had applications out for jobs that I applied for in March and in May that were still showing as \u201copen\u201d, the jobs were still posted. I truly believe each of them hired a caregiver and did not close the post. There are problems with the site. The site is also a great tool and resource, but they make no guarantees and are not miracle workers."

Apparently that\u2019s when the grandparents who are currently doing the babysitting are moving. Well, anyway, they conducted a background check, it cleared on Monday, they called my references, which I know are all good because I\u2019m in contact with them and they told me so...and I\u2019ve heard nothing since. The last thing they told me was to approve the background check, I did, I saw that it went through, I got back to them and told them, they told me they viewed it...and I thanked them and told them I\u2019m available to start as soon as they need me. I can see my own background check, I don\u2019t have so much as a parking ticket so this isn\u2019t the issue. I just don\u2019t know why they haven\u2019t answered me. Also, in that timeframe, I went on two other interviews and the most recent one offered me a job with pretty much the same hours. What should I say to the other family that wanted me to start the second week of October? I don\u2019t want to turn this job down if for some reason they decided they don\u2019t want to hire me or if they figured something else out in regard to childcare. What do I do? I greatly appreciate any advice here."

Because that is what your title(full or part-time and then babysitter or nanny) and your calendar are currently depicting . I didn't get a chance to ask what type of job you are on the lookout for. But if any of that is not accurate you definitely want to edit some of that.\n\nGreat job with being CPR and First Aid Certified!\n\nIt's always great to adda Background check and to go premium if you can.\n\nI think $30/hr is a little high for where you live. Try to narrow your range. Some families want quick answers and will just skip over you if the range is too big because you MIGHT turn out to be \"too expensive\" for them.\n\nThe number 1 thing that you should be doing to improve your profile is to collect reviews. I know you said you come from a big family, so definitely have some of those folks writing you personal references and if you by any chance can ask the folks at the Academy to leave you some reviews that would be awesome. Parents want to be able to picture what it will be like to have you in their house in the role they are trying to fill. Also once you get 3 reviews (and fill a few other criteria) you can qualify for a carepro badge that will help you when parents are actually filtering their results by those who have one.\n\nI highly suggest, if you'd like, to post your bio to the discussion board and asked the ladies to help you edit it. There are some punctuation and sentence structure issues. Fairly minor.\n\nMake sure any family that hires you \"marks you as hired\" (as long as that feature currently works on the site) and always do your best and ask for reviews. I have tips for how to ask for reviews if you need that too. Just let me know!\n\nLet me know if you have any questions, Jennifer!"

My name is Sam and I am a classically trained musician in two instruments living in SE Ann Arbor, Michigan.\n\nFinding a good job in any industry is certainly going to be challenging and even more so in one as competitive as childcare.  \n\nI am happy to offer suggestions on steps you can take to improve your chances finding a good fit with a family.\n1. Clean Profile\u2014your bio is a business profile so make it look like one as you highlight skills, experience, certifications, education, unique qualities, etc.  Check for proper spelling and grammar as you edit, revise, tweak and rewrite until you are satisfied with end result.\n2. Applications \u2014Just like your bio, a well written letter of application is going to be noticed.  In addition to skills and experience, be sure to acknowledge what family is looking for as you mention examples listed in job posting.  There\u2019s no telling how many letters you\u2019ll send before you land a hit so don\u2019t give up.\n3. Background Check\u2014Having a background check on file is definitely a scale tipper; it shows families you\u2019re serious about your services.\n4. References\u2014These days, it\u2019s not just what you can do or know but also who you know that spells the difference between victory and defeat.\n5. Reviews \u2014Having reviews/feedback on your profile also makes a difference; for any child caring you\u2019ve done in any capacity (friends, neighbors, families on care.com, etc.), see if they\u2019ll write a review to help boost your chances of getting noticed.\n6. Certifications\u2014are you certified in CPR/First-Aid?\n7. Education\u2014Can your field(s) of study be applied in childcare industry (I.e., degree in ECE)?  I for example majored in psychology and minored in music and am able to apply both with children I care for in many creative and imaginative ways.\n\nAfter getting further consideration from interested family, prepare set of questions to ask your potential employer that are relevant to job that weren\u2019t mentioned in posting.\n\nIf you are selected for position, get arrangement in writing to cover all bases and prevent being recipient of short end of stick.  Make sure your contract has guaranteed pay within set/agreed schedule, a cancellation policy, paid vacation, paid sick days, holiday pay, overtime pay if working more than 40 hours (or in some states, more than 8 hours in a day), severance pay, late payment clause, and anything else you think is necessary.  \n\nAs a single mother, you have the added challenge of finding a family that is open and accepting to idea of caregiver bringing own children to cut down cost of care so be sure to establish that detail early in the job search process (maybe include in letter of application somehow).  \n\nI\u2019m sure other users will have suggestions I neglected to mention but hopefully this will give you a good jump start.  Good luck."

I\u2019ve had one good interview, I\u2019m having another interview with another family on Friday and a phone interview from another family that night. Keep trying and don\u2019t give up. You have to be patient it takes time and I\u2019d hope a family doesn\u2019t hire too quickly. It\u2019s good to take time to think and really make sure both the family and nanny or babysitter are a right fit."

	"text": "Hello, i am an older woman that has been on care.com for many years with great success.  I would say the following to 20 year olds and adults.    The only difference is our age and I believe there are alot of people that will give you a chance with the following comments:\n\nKnow as a teenager caregiver the reality is you do not have the years of experience.\n\nHowever, within 2 weeks of showing up 5 minutes early, leaving your cell phone off, bring and 5 x 7 ring note pad and be prepared to take notes regarding  the following:\nAges of children\n\nNames ; write them down it is easy to get nervous and forget. (Adults too). \n\nDress appropriately, casual nice clothes.\n\nRemember to not show up preferably chewing a bunch of gum.\n\nWrite down nap times\n\nTake a babysitting course for teens. \n\n I have found the more certified courses you are taking the better the chance to get that job.\n\nWrite down meal times\n\nWrite down contact numbers and ask if it is more than one person leaving which person to call first. .\n\nAll parents should ask you if you have taken CPR, THAT is a class the red cross (or local fire station) offers for infants and children  as well as adults and seniors. \n\nBe polite, no loud music! Respect the area you are in.  (AGAIN THE SAME FOR.ADULTS)\n\nNo friends over ABSOLUTELY NO!\n\nAs I said I am am adult, and it is not an.easy job and I admire you for reaching out to ask.  But, a very rewarding job, and I believe a very good reality for you.  You have been doing this for 5 years so you must like one or two things about it\n\nCommon sense is having a background check ready to share\n\nIf you will be driving the children, allow me to mention an extremely important ISSUE - THE CORRECT TYPE OF DRIVERS insurance FOR CAREGIVERS.\n\nThis is different in every area, and if you are driving with your insurance and your car and are getting paid by your client, remember you can be reimbursed for mileage as well as you will be liable for any thing that happens to the children in a accident. (They are typically  not covered under personal auto insurance, when a client is paying you), but please check with your Car Insurance Agent!\n\nTo avoid this, let them know you drive, but if you take their car you wont need the special insursnce.  As a teenager sitter, I realize that your rates vary based on where you live? But quite frankly all of the issues would add up very fast.  It would be rare in my opinion that they would ask you to drive them anywhere but I do not know the specific situation.\n\nPlease supply your prospective clients (if you feel it is an good fit.  Meaning they are people you feel will meet your qualifications as well.  It goes both ways. After you have been doing this for 15 plus years, you will realize that there are many clients that you will get along great with! But the reverse is true.  Some personalities just do not match.  This takes time and experience but I feel.you will do a great job.   Do not take those situations seriously.  It is not about you.  Move on with positive attitudes and the ability to provide excellent service to your next clients.\n\nAlso, at NSO (nurses service oganization) OR insuranceBee.com they offer very fair priced liability insurance for a part time sitter for 109.00 a year. \n(Liability insurance) which I think of above and beyond for you, but i think clients are asking for this more and more.   \n\nCare.com does not tolerate any misuse of their system or their care.com employees, but we need to remember they are assisting us by gathering all of these wonderful Jobs!\n\nAll the best!\n\nDeborah H."

Having experience caring for children and their developmental needs, various credentials, \nFirst Aid/CPR certification can give you a boost. \n- Purchase the criminal/MVR background check.\n- Get reviews from past employers, friends, and family. \n- Apply to lots of jobs. \n- Respond to your messages A.S.A.P. Families appreciate that. \n- Be patient. Families are being inundated with many applications and it takes time to read through them and decide which candidates they're interested in speaking with. The last family I worked with had over 70 applications. Whew!\n- If you have the premium membership, a good bio, background check, and excellent reviews, the families will most likely seek you out, instead of waiting for you to apply to the position. \nI'm sure there's much more advice out there in the community of caregivers. In my experience, this has worked for me. \nGood luck to you! \ud83d\ude0a\n~ Kelly"

Since I go to school full time, I only babysit regularly for one family every Friday and Saturday from 9:00-4:00 or 4:30. I have a few families I do date nights for, and I also do petsitting here and there. I keep my account on here just in case there\u2019s a one time babysitting job, a petsitting gig while someone is on vacation, etc. I need to make all the money I can around my busy school schedule! I have 5 star reviews in both childcare and petcare. My question is, how do you guys feel when people ask you for references? I have never felt comfortable enough with a family to ask them to be a reference for someone to call when I\u2019ll probably only be working with them every once in awhile. My family that I work for now is super busy (dad owns two businesses, mom is 8 months pregnant and a nurse practitioner), so I don\u2019t feel that they have time to take phone calls every time I\u2019m interviewing for a new position. All the other families I do date nights for are similarly busy. I always tell potential employers I\u2019m willing to open my background check to them if they request it. I feel that my reviews should be good enough testaments to my character. What do you guys think? Thanks!"

	"text": "I personally don\u2019t spend the money on premium. I understand it has its advantages, but, to me, it\u2019s not right to ask job seekers to pay and give employers the option not to. Any employer not willing to cough up some money for a membership (which is pennies compared to an agency cost), is unlikely going to be paying their nanny or sitter the money they are worth. I think it opens it up to more scammers and predators, too, in my opinion. So, as you may be able to tell, my choices are based on principle. But if I was searching for date-night or petsitting gigs, not full-time nanny jobs, my outlook may be different. Although, on SitterCity, I can find those jobs without paying, since asking caregivers to pay is not something SitterCity does. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nUnless you are looking for date-night gigs only, I wouldn\u2019t pay for your own background checks, especially if money is tight. What I did was include in my applications that I was willing to undergo any background or drug tests they require. That lets them know that it\u2019s not that I\u2019m trying to hide anything. Once you get further in the process, like after interviews, if the family is intent on hiring you, they can request the check and that allows them to pay for it, not you. This is for long-term positions. If you\u2019re only doing date-night or petsitting, I would be tempted to pay for one, personally, but only if I was getting some interest. And again, add in your applications that you\u2019re willing to get one. But I was only looking for long-term jobs, so I let the employer pay for them. \nTo add in my story, I was able to get a job without paying premium. I was unemployed at the time and had no income coming in. I was trying to save as much money as possible, which included not spending money on frivolous things like clothes and eating out, so it\u2019s not like I was just being cheap and stubborn. I really didn\u2019t feel like I had the money, and I get very anxious about money. To me, this wasn\u2019t a cost I wanted to endure. People feel differently about it, and we are all entitled to our own opinions and views. I just wanted to share mine with you. \nOne thing you can do is give it a try without it, but if you\u2019re not having luck within a few months, revisit the option. Especially if you are finding that you are applying to jobs that already have so many applicants, and not getting responses. One thing about premium is getting that early notification so you\u2019re able to be one of the first to apply. That was the feature that appealed to me, but I wanted to give it a try without premium. I told myself I would revisit the option in a couple of months if I was still unemployed. \nI hope this made sense and has helped you! Like I said, we all have different opinions, but it\u2019s good to read a variety of experiences so you can make an informed decision \ud83d\ude0a Good luck!"

	"text": "Ok, so currently I work for an awesome family. My day starts at 6:15am and ends at 6pm (split shifts.) was ideal for me, as I have kids of my own and my husband was able to bring them to the bus every morning (he worked nights at the time) and I was always home when they got home from school then my family member would take over for an hour or so. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing: my husband is a police officer. He was promoted a month ago, but his chief never said anything about changing his schedule. Yesterday he found out he will be working the earliest shift possible. My husband\u2019s job basically pays all the major bills (mortgage, utilities, etc) but I do pay for my day to day expenses and my car lease. He offered to take whatever overtime comes up if this leaves me temporarily jobless and help me pay for those things, and there are usually a ton of opportunities for overtime between Oct-Dec so this is not the main issue. Still, even with overtime (which isn\u2019t guaranteed), we live in an expensive area and on a cop\u2019s salary, we don\u2019t have a lot of money to spare...especially on a babysitter for 2 hours every morning and I doubt I\u2019ll find one this last minute anyway. I believe I can find a job that suits his hours eventually, but what should I do right now is the question? He has to be at work at 6am next Monday and our daughters have to get to the bus. As much as I adore the family I work for, my kids come first and we can survive for a month or two without my job, but we can\u2019t without his. \n\nAny suggestions? I feel truly awful, but turning down a promotion is not an option for my husband and hiring a last minute sitter I can\u2019t thoroughly background check and interview is also not an option. I realize I\u2019m leaving the family I work for in a bad situation too, but both parents seem to be able to work from home at their convenience. I\u2019m not sure if they can do this long term but earlier this year, I had a death in the immediate family and was out for an extended period of time and they alternated working from home. Obviously my husband and I don\u2019t have those options. I am very upset about this. Please help :("

I personally believe that this care check for all babysitters is a great thing but I do have a problem with it. What about the safety for us nannies and babysitters that we have to give our life history from soup to nuts but none of these families are required to do a background check so us nannies know where are personal information is going. I have nothing to hide I am a NY state certified teacher who has been fingerprinted for jobs in the schools (part of the hiring process) I think that care.com should think about having these background checks work both ways.

There have been multiple deaths of children under the age of 1.  As well the rape of  a 7 year old girl, and many other children who have been abused because of the manipulative, sneaky and dangerous individuals who take advantage of this platform. A simple google search will inform you why it is so important that we advocate for these children. Honestly im nervous my account will be removed after i make this post. \n\n1. Care.com babysitter Sarah Gumm was convicted of murder and sentenced to 23 years in jail for beating a 3-month-old to death. Prior to registering on Care.com she had two DUIs, a \u201cbattery incident,\u201d and a felony charge \u2014 all of which went undetected by Care.com\u2019s background check.\n\n2. Care.com babysitter Sarah Cullen was convicted of murder and sentenced to 70 years in jail for killing a 4-month-old child. She had a DUI prior to registering on Care.com.\n\n3. Care.com babysitter Aisling McCarthy Brady had no prior criminal history prior to registering on Care.com, but had overstayed her visa. A one-year-old died in her care. She was found not guilty in a criminal charge, but the family was later awarded $4 million in a new lawsuit.\n\n4. On March 2018, Care.com babysitter Jonathan Tavara-Nima was sentenced to 25 years for raping a seven-year-old girl he met on Care.com. Care.com said his account \u201cwould be removed and blacklisted.\u201d Care.com didn\u2019t mention that he had been arrested for child pornography charges five years earlier.\n\n\nThis is for the real nannies, the ones who live and breath for the finger painting, for the peppa pig songs, for the cuddles, for the ones who choose to advocate for children. Some how some way we do need a change to this platform so the children will be safe\n\npeace &amp; love"

	"text": "One- it is a legit site! I've used it for years. There are definitely some major downsides though that you will discover.\nTwo- always do a phone interview first, meet in a public place second and give their address to a family member for records. You can always ask a family to provide a background check for your safety, I've never had a issue except some parents cussing me out because of their personal issues then later apologizing. I've never had a safety problem. I would only go after families that have photos, a lot of activity and have unique posts (don't sound like multiple other posts).\nThree- it will go away after time! It needs a certain amount of applications and you also need to get reviews for it to kick off. People will see you, you just won't appear high on searches. You get more luck applying to jobs you want rather than people trying to reach out anyway.\n\nBest of luck dear!"

	"text": "Hello, it\u2019s not too hard if you put in some effort so I\u2019ll try to give you a quick and to -the-point response :). So basically you apply for jobs that you think you would be suited for, and families can reply back to you through the care website. It\u2019s a lot of a waiting game and being consistent in applying for jobs, but something should eventually come through. Also, you don\u2019t have to, but I\u2019ve found much better success when I got a premium membership. This allows families to reply to you if they don\u2019t have a membership, and even reach out to you if they think you\u2019d be a good fit for a job. Also, make sure you have a really good profile, as that\u2019s the first thing families look at. Make sure to ask for some reviews from friends or people you\u2019ve babysat for, because reviews look really good on your profile! Also, if you do end up trying the membership for a month, make sure to get a background check/ automobile check, one of those comes with the membership. Just stay consistent and don\u2019t lose hope, good luck!"

I recently signed up with another site (don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll take this down if I mention it by name) and for one - it\u2019s free to communicate with parents and for a background check and 2.) you can also rate them. It\u2019s fairly new and I just started using it but if it catches on, I can\u2019t imagine Care being able to compete if it takes off. \n\nI had an experience where I worked for a family who found me on here and...just...well, I don\u2019t even know where to begin. Their 4 year old son was violent and beat up his baby sister and the cat, and then he hurt himself throwing a tantrum outside, but somehow when I told the parents this...their response was to get mad at me for going in their medicine cabinet to get him a band aid. There were a ton of prescription pills in the medicine cabinet so I don\u2019t know, maybe they didn\u2019t want me to see them, but I didn\u2019t look and I don\u2019t care. I only even thought of it once I noticed how angry the mom was about me going into a medicine cabinet for a band aid. It was truly bizarre. They probably were afraid of how I\u2019d reply so they didn\u2019t write a bad review but the job was nothing like as described and I wish I could warn other sitters about these people.\n\nAlso, there have been several parents on here falsely advertising. They\u2019ll put $20-$25/hour and then at the last minute give you a sob story about how they can only afford $12. They\u2019re doing this to attract the best sitters and I wish I hadn\u2019t wasted my time meeting with several of them. I am fortunate enough to not have gotten a bad review from any of them yet, but it could happen and it seems very unfair."

If you want to trust someone to care for your little one, you should trust them in return too, especially when you have gone through the interviews and saw that they have a background check on their profile, care for other families, have reviews... Also, you don\u2019t need to specifically say where the camera is at but at least let her know that you have one as a heads up. Like some people said, some are uncomfortable with it and others don\u2019t mind. But, it\u2019s always good to start as honest person just like when kids have special needs.\nI personally don\u2019t care if cameras are their or not, but being audiotaped is not something that I am fond of.

	"text": "This is the \"base\" application I send. I always add job specific stuff to it when applying. If they want someone who can help with Spanish I specify that I have taken 5 years of it, if they want you to be comfortable around pets I mention that my dog is a 1 year old mini aussie, that sort of thing. My best piece of advice for you is to apply as early as possible and mention specifics for the things they are looking for.\nI've received messages back from 6 out of the 14 applications I have sent this week, 4 of which were to set up interviews and the other 2 were just asking for clarification on my availability. I am in no way saying this the perfect application, but it may help if are just starting out!\n(I've removed location stuff from this which is why there are blanks)\n\nHello! My name is Shelby and I am currently a pharmacy student at _. I noticed you are looking for a summer babysitter. Here is a little bit more about me:\n\nI have been a babysitter ever since I was in middle school when I would babysit the younger kids of family friends. I have no problem with cooking, cleaning, laundry, or coming up with entertaining and educational activities. I am also CPR/first aid certified and I do have my own car. Included is access to my vehicle background check.\n\nI love going on hikes with my dog and swimming in Lake Michigan. I have experience tutoring kids in math, science, and Spanish. I have taken courses in Spanish, American Sign Language, chemistry, biology, and math through calculus. I also love anything that has to do with art: crafting, drama, dance, music, you name it. I have 15 years of dance experience and 7 years of theater experience. In the summers of 2013 and 2014, I was an intern with _ Civic Theater where I would assist with their child theater program, so I also know how to teach a large group of kids.\n\nMy availability: As of right now I have completely open availability for this summer starting June 21.\n\nIf you have any questions for me please let me know. Your family sounds awesome and I would love the chance to work with you, even if it's just as a date night sitter!\n\nThank you for your time and consideration. I hope to hear from you soon!"

The caregiving Independent Private Caregiving Business is all about the clients needs.  If you are just starting out, I would ask them, what is the rate you are paying for this, but I would not ask that until later down the interview road. \n\nWhat I have experienced after 17 years of experience, is that money is the last thing to be talked about. \n\nIn Washington State, with the experience I have in Advanced Alzheimer's, Geriatric Care, Congested Heart failure, as well as numerous post operation experience, I walk in, and get to know them first.   \n\nAlways listen to the client and their needs.    There are some people that will try and pay you a very low wage.  You know your experience, you know why you are getting into this business. \n\nMy biggest piece of advice, is to become Certified in many areas of aging. \n\nThere are Certificates of all types, and having those certificates on your resume on Care.com really show a person that is faithfully interested in doing this for reasons other than money.   You need to have a giving heart, and I am sure you do, but there are people that do this job, because there is a shortage of people, and unfortunately this has split the private professional care givers from the Assisted Living and Independent Living Caregivers. \n\nRemember, we are in a situation, where caregiving is going to be at its highest demand in the next 10-20 years.  \n\nI would become a Certified Elder Care Advocate, as well as a Geriatric Assistant (without the RN), as that allows you credentials that are well respected. \n\nI know this is way more than you asked for, but like I said, I have a book of knowledge on my 17 years. \n\nThe other last thing I would do is show everyone you have purchased a 50 state Criminal and Felony background check.  There are many that do not.  It leaves no questions that you are clear of these issues. \n\nGood luck, and do your best. \n\nD. Helm."

I believe they do that to get people to apply but they are getting the job seeker\u2019s hopes up thinking they are going to paid X amount of dollars per hour to only be told something different. Like I said I know what it\u2019s like because I have young baby myself but being honest gets much more respect and the possibility of someone who\u2019d be willing to work with them. I just had an interview with a young mother of 4/5 kids and she seemed to really be interested in hiring me up until the pay became part of the interview. She\u2019d listed her pay as $12-16/hr five days at 35 hours per week. Well, I was really shooting for the $16 per hour but after speaking with her I thought to myself that I would accept $14/15 per hour considering the situation. She told me that she was only going to pay $13 per hour and then tried to tell me about how much the state says minimum pay for child care is about $10.50 per hour. I did not make any comments towards that because if I had I knew I\u2019d automatically be disqualified in her eyes even though I have years worth of experience with kids. What I did was told her that I\u2019d accept $14/15 per hour seeing that she had 4/5 kids with the oldest being 12 years old if I remember right. Not to mention she wanted light housekeeping and for someone to continue teaching Spanish to the kids. She told me that she\u2019d be reaching back out to me about the pay because her parents were the ones who\u2019d be paying. Then she said she\u2019ll let me know by the end of the week after reviewing all applicants and running background checks. Well, the very next day she\u2019d chosen someone else which I already knew she was not interested in hiring me due to the pay because everything else went well. I was not upset about it but this is just an example and I honestly was not going to accept $13 per hour for 4/5 kids, light housekeeping, and teaching Spanish. That\u2019s 3 different jobs if you think about. I mean care. com has it set up for one to list jobs under each one of those. I just want to help some of the job seekers out because there are people who will try to get over."

I can't send multiple responses to the families, because I've already done it once and there is no way to send a follow up with them.

	"text": "Hey guys ! So I just wanted to get some opinion about background checks. I recently applied to a nanny position and I exchanged a few messages on the website with the family and it seemed to be a good fit for both of us. So we agreed to set up a meeting for me to come to their place and meet the kids. The mom messaged me to say that she would like to run a background check on me before giving me a time and address for the meeting which I agreed to because she did it through care.com . She sent me a link and all I had to do was agreed to it. I then got an email notification saying that the background check was ready and only me and this family was able to see it. I messaged her to check if she had received it and she said yes that she\u2019ll take a look later that day. It\u2019s been 2 days and I haven\u2019t heard from them at all. I know think that maybe I shouldn\u2019t have agreed to the background check before meeting them. It does show my full name address and last 4 digits of social on it. What are your thoughts on that ??"

	"text": "Unfortunately care.com does not require or even have a way of running background checks on families. I complained about that in an App Store review and they just brushed it off saying their sight was safe. \n\nIt it\u2019s basically all up to you to do your due diligence. My recommendations are:\n1. Only apply to families that have a profile picture\n2. I don\u2019t give any of my personal information out until after an in-person meeting (that includes releasing my background check for them)\n3. Never take an in-person interview without a phone interview first. Not just for safety, lots of people lie/embellish in their posts and then you\u2019ll find out it\u2019s not at all what you were thinking. So don\u2019t waste your time on an in-person interview just to find out it\u2019s not a match\n4. I do not EVER for any reason meet with a family in a private setting. If they aren\u2019t cooperative with finding a public place to meet, move on to another family. \n5. Ask for references for the family. You\u2019re going to be in their home, you have the right to verify their aren\u2019t crazy people just as much as they have that right for you. \n\nI hope this helps you get started. Hopefully Care.com will see the error of their ways soon and have background checks for families as well."

	"text": "For me, I find that I need to make sure the family is serious about me before ever meeting up with them.\n\nI find that some families can give you a \u2018false hope\u2019 to keep you on a sting so that you don\u2019t apply elsewhere...just so they have you as a backup.\n\nI experienced this with 3 families back-to-back \u2014 families hiring me \u2018they say\u2019 then not following through. In the meantime, I would have several other families trying to interview me, but I had to decline because I was already on the hook with the family that said they wanted to hire me.\n\nAnyway, this only happened 3 times back to back...and then I learned my lesson.  I use a lot of intuition and pay close attention to the person I am chatting with. If I find any ambiguity or changing of meet-up times, etc...then I find a way out of the interview so I don\u2019t waste time.\n\nI have found the best jobs to be the ones where they found me first. I don\u2019t ever apply anymore. I just make my profile as good & flexible as possibly so that they will seek me out. I asked for reviews, I paid for the criminal background check, I pay the monthly fee so that I am advertised first, I get certified for first aid, CPR & swimming training, child development classes, I mark \u2018yes\u2019 on almost every service offered even though I my main focus is to take care of the kids...and not clean the house.\n\nMy bio mentions how safety conscious that I am. I say something like \u201cI am happy to adhere to parental guidelines, but I am very safety conscious, so there will be times that I use my own judgment to make sure the child is safe.\u201d  This is actually true about me.\n\nIt took time to develop a good reputation so that families would seek me out. I had to be strategic.\n\nHere\u2019s another tip, if a family says that they will pay between $12-18 per hour, what they really mean is that...they won\u2019t pay more than $12 per hour - period! So, I don\u2019t even apply to jobs that mention a pay rate that I cannot do. I don\u2019t like wasting time.\n\nAlso, I have come to learn that families like lots of references. When you do get a reference, make sure it is a 5 star. The first 3 references set the \u2018tone\u2019 for your desirability.\n\nAnyway, again...just \u2018change your game\u2019 and figure out what works best for you. Also, you need to remember...for every job posted, there are about 40-50 applicants. So...be the first to apply. Be excited that they interviewed you - it\u2019s a good sign!"

	"text": "I am struggling to know how to deal with a situation I am in, tonight alone I have done a lot of reading up on this and I do not believe I am wrong for feeling this way. \n\nA mom of two 3- year old twins interviewed me saying \u201cit would be $20 for the hour in cash biweekly\u201d. I assumed the hourly rate was due to her requesting I provide vehicle; that would naturally require gas and she made a point to ask about maintenance dates on. \n\nThe day of the interview her and the husband asked to see if the car seats would fit in my car and when I asked how she wanted the car seats handled as far as pick up and drop offs since that is all she really needs twice a week plus about an hour of diaper changes and brushed teeth/hair and getting ready for school she told me they already ordered new ones and to keep the old ones in my car. I thought this was very trusting as she just met me that day.  She then let me know Tuesday she had taken off work to do a trial run with me, so I assumed we were working on a trial basis which many families do prefer for the kids to adapt. She also said many days she would not need me because her husband\u2019s job is based on the weather and if it rained he could handle the girls. I did inform her I had more interviews that weekend that may offer me more hours as well so we would see how it went. \n\nI arrived Tuesday and informed her I had accepted a more regularly scheduled position with another family near by, as her and her husband only needed me Tuesday and Thursday mornings for about 2 hours each day. I told her for now the two jobs did not overlap. After drop off I felt very juvenile because of her constant and extremely specific directions of not only where to turn but also exactly what lane to remain in while driving and how to approach each car at every stop light or intersection. We made small talk up to returning her to the front of her home and before she exited the car she said I plan to pay you for today but since you are being paid biweekly this first time you wont be paid for three weeks you know. I said if it ended up being based on her paychecks that was fine with me, Then I asked \u201chow would you like me to track my hours for you?\u201d she quickly informed me \u201coh well its only $20 every time you come.\u201d \n\nIn shock I said \u201cokay well we can try this for a little but I will need to crunch some numbers to see if that is even financially even feasible.\u201c\n\nShe got upset sounding very quickly and replied \u201cIf this isn\u2019t going to work I need to know now or I will not have care for my children.\u201d\n\nI assured her I was a professional and that on past jobs I hired and trained my replacements I would never leave a parent in a pinch with zero warning. \n\nSo help me out with your advice and experiences, its 30 minutes to her home and back to mine, and hour of in home prep with the kids for school, 10 ish minutes to the school maybe more if traffic plus drop off circle. All in all over 2 hours, equals less then $10 an hour of my time MINUS my car and gas expenses. I\u2019m sorry for this family and what this situation has become however it\u2019s very uncomfortable and unfair to me I would think? They seem like a nice and loving family but also very unrealistic about child-care and the basic etiquette of acquiring in home assistance. And did I mention she already canceled Thursday this week? I mean I am not a 16 year old living at home who you know through your local church community! This is a profession I have 15 years of experience in. I am also a college graduate who has managed entire households in order to provide for my needs and the needs of my family while I funded and earned my Bachelors Degree in Public Health and Nutrition; which has MANY applications in this line of work. At one point in 2015 I was paid a 45K salary for doing this exact line of work. I just want to know if I am being unreasonable in my thought process here and how to present to her with what I guess my resignation while remaining as professional as I can in this extremely awkward position? I was not officially offered this job and I would of never of accepted these terms if they had been clearly outlined like this upfront. I feel I was basically handed car seats in what I thought was a act of good faith for a trial run but it has defiantly taken a turn for the distressing. They need to know asap I cannot stay for their good and mine, I\u2019m almost insulted at the compensation, who would wake up at 6am to drive over 60 minutes for $20? \n\nMy thoughts are to explain to her via email the misunderstanding and maybe copy a link of some of the advice articles on care.com (or any credible source) regarding finding assistance for your family and the traditional etiquette and procedures that are most commonly practiced? I am happy to take partial blame for assuming some things like we were in a trial phase but honestly common practice and my experience truly made me feel comfortable up until I was driving away with car seats for a job I wasn\u2019t even sure I had been offered officially yet?\n\nAdvice please? Thoughts on any my feelings about this? Thanks in advance for the help guys!\n\n(P.S.) I did not even mention that the mom asked me for two things when I left with car seats that also made me feel I was on trial and the job was not yet officially offered or accepted long term. 1) she requested background check and driving record plus 2) that I fill out an 89! essay question style questionnaire about my care practices and beliefs as a nanny. I feel so bad about this whole situation but it has truly added so much stress to my thoughts recently and I want to offer to help her if they are in a bind for maybe 2 weeks but I cant do it to my own detriment, I have school (working towards my masters) and now two overlapping jobs as I accepted one Sunday that needed to begin Monday and my old job was already scheduled and I need to remain professional in BOTH as is true to my character."

Mom was a doctor & needed a break from her kids on weekends to rest. Husband wasn\u2019t around too often, he was always off at parties, golfing with buddies or having lunch/dinner meetings with friends. Glad he wasn\u2019t around much because Mom was very sweet & kind but whenever Dad was around, they always argued & yelled at each other even with me there. I began feeling uncomfortable under a couple different occasions. First, when the 1yr-old would cry Bloody Mary at the sight of her paternal grandmother. Idk what it was about her but baby just wouldn\u2019t have it. She would cling on to me for her dear life just so her grandmother wouldn\u2019t touch her. It made me feel so sad & also wonder wtf her grandma ever did to her for her to react like that at just the sight of her. Second, I began to notice that dad would start looking at me inappropriately. I never go to a job wearing tight or provocative clothing or clothes that accentuates my curves. I always wear baggy clothing so that I can hide my figure. But this guy would just stare at me & i would feel so uncomfortable. Glad I stopped working there. \n\n\nAnother time was with a Chinese family. Mom wanted to raise children under Montessori method but house was MESS. I\u2019m talking unfolded laundry all over the couch, dirty dishes piled up high, bathroom full of dirty clothes/cleaning supplies/dirty tub & sink. Even the baby\u2019s high chair was disgusting. It was an old, peeled pleather highchair that always smelled like rotten food & vomit. It was the worst. I would get nauseous just being in there. On top of that, baby had an older brother about 3yrs older & mom would tell me to be mean to older boy & tell him to go away because I was only there to take care of baby. Mom was pretty harsh on older son too. Wouldn\u2019t hug him or cuddle him like she would the baby. Very stressful place to be. On top of that, she wanted me to do a specific background check that she wanted & wanted me to pay for. I had never heard of the background check she was requiring & didn\u2019t know what steps I needed to take to get it done so I\u2019m sure it upset her that it took me a minute to figure it out. Didn\u2019t offer to help me out with it, just kinda threw me into the deep end & told me to swim. Highly disorganized household let me tell yah."

The premium comes with a free motor vehicle record check as long as you are still a premium member, hence no need to buy the background check which alone is $33/6mo. You can learn more about the benefits of premium if you look through the popular topics. You can buy it but If you don\u2019t know how to make it useful, then you Will be wasting your time.\nAlso, your experiences, education, certifications, location, who you are competing with, what the parents are seeking in a caregivers, your rate ....all of of those are big factors that contribute into landing a jobs not just the premium.

I have I think nearly a dozen references or more on my own profile... \n\nOpen yourself up to more than just being a nanny.. offer tutoring, pet care, errands, cleaning, laundry, nutritionists background or household management, party planner etc. if you\u2019ve got experience doing stuff all sorts of stuff then list it... on your profile... \n\nYou\u2019ll be snatched up luckily split if you follow the advice given in this website... \n\nAlso know what the local average nanny wage is for your area.. I set mine at $5 + hire than everyone else\u2019s average because of my experience and knowledge in childcare and household management... I\u2019m well worth my starting price point. And I do not accept less than my value. Also I recommend not working under the table.. which many nanny\u2019s apparently do... if you work for a family do it legitimately... \n\nJust my FYI from my 30 years of experience working with families... \n\nAir hugs and blessings on your future endeavors.. \n\nNanny Sherri"

I got help from the county to mentally get help getting over child abuse and believe me, some other people in the room had MUCH worse things to share than I've ever heard. \nI'm so glad those little girls would come over to MY house when their Uncle and Father were molesting any of them.

There have been multiple deaths of children under the age of 1.  As well the rape of  a 7 year old girl, and many other children who have been abused because of the manipulative, sneaky and dangerous individuals who take advantage of this platform. A simple google search will inform you why it is so important that we advocate for these children. Honestly im nervous my account will be removed after i make this post. \n\n1. Care.com babysitter Sarah Gumm was convicted of murder and sentenced to 23 years in jail for beating a 3-month-old to death. Prior to registering on Care.com she had two DUIs, a \u201cbattery incident,\u201d and a felony charge \u2014 all of which went undetected by Care.com\u2019s background check.\n\n2. Care.com babysitter Sarah Cullen was convicted of murder and sentenced to 70 years in jail for killing a 4-month-old child. She had a DUI prior to registering on Care.com.\n\n3. Care.com babysitter Aisling McCarthy Brady had no prior criminal history prior to registering on Care.com, but had overstayed her visa. A one-year-old died in her care. She was found not guilty in a criminal charge, but the family was later awarded $4 million in a new lawsuit.\n\n4. On March 2018, Care.com babysitter Jonathan Tavara-Nima was sentenced to 25 years for raping a seven-year-old girl he met on Care.com. Care.com said his account \u201cwould be removed and blacklisted.\u201d Care.com didn\u2019t mention that he had been arrested for child pornography charges five years earlier.\n\n\nThis is for the real nannies, the ones who live and breath for the finger painting, for the peppa pig songs, for the cuddles, for the ones who choose to advocate for children. Some how some way we do need a change to this platform so the children will be safe\n\npeace &amp; love"

Give it a try with a premium since it gives you a free motor vehicle record check and you can message parents back and forth, you get an alert to apply for jobs ahead of others and you can look at the parents profile who viewed your profile as well. Most parents will look to see if you have a background check badge and a CPR certification which are very important. But with the motor vehicle record record badge that is still  better even if you can\u2019t afford the background check.\nCompetition is rude since parents look at your education, age, experiences... and much more. Feel free to check out previous jobs on how to land jobs you will find a lot. Good luck!"

I m gonna tell you what I would do if I were you: if you are not looking to get married and have kids right away, finish your degree and learn Spanish maybe, or a second language, if you have time.\nThen, I would move to a big city (NY, Miami, LA). There are plenty of rich people looking for nannies. The best and safest way to do it is through nanny agencies (Google that). They do a thorough background check and then can place you with families according to your needs. \nJust to give you an example: I saw in indeed and here, offers for full time nanny for a busy upscale family in Manhattan,  rotating during the month with 3 other nannies (you work 7 days live in, you rest 7, you can go home). The pay was between 80.000 to 100.000 a year and they were asking just for high school diploma.\nNow, the 7 days you are working there might not be exactly heaven on earth but hey, for 100.000 a year you might have to swallow some bitter moments, if you know what I mean.\nThat s just one example, you can find other options, but living in with a family in a big city can give you a great salary and you might not have to spend money at all in rent and utilities and food (you eat with them!), all the money for you!\nAgain, living in with a (rich) family can be very financially rewarding but it might come to a price. You just have to find out if you are willing to do so. I would totally try it out if I were your age (I m getting old! Hehe)\nLook online, nanny agencies, anywhere you want, but bigger cities, more chances, more money.\nEnjoy and take it easy! Life will certainly show you a path.\nBest,\n\nJulia"

If you\u2019re physically active talk about how you have plenty of energy to run around after little ones. Google search \u201cbabysitter resum\u00e9\u201d to find out what\u2019s currently trending.

( we had some things in common so i figured they're just being friendly ) we all hung out and laughed and had a great time. we figured out my pay, most of my schedule, duties.. all of it. it went really well and they hired me and told me my start date. next day they tell me they're not going to hire me because they realized they can't afford it. \n( they both have successful businesses they already told me about and they came into a big chunk of money a while back. and i obviously went to their house so i know they are pretty damn wealthy ) \nthey also have a maid, a chef, grocery delivery, laundry service, and babysitter that they pay for.. i was going to replace all of that and it would've costed them less. \nthey're both insanely busy and out of town super often.. \nhow would they all of the sudden not need someone?\nwhy did they lie? why would someone seriously waste my time like that?

How does Care expect people looking for a jobs to have $20 per month plus the money for a background check? Job sites like Indeed and Career Builder don\u2019t charge anything at all and in what universe does the employee provide the background check? Most employers conduct hundreds of them at their expense, plus a drug test. Not to mention they have to pay their employees benefits. Care is making a lot of money off of us and it\u2019s not right. The parents are getting free background checks and cheap labor and Care does nothing about that either. I hope there is an alternative soon."

Got the 2 older kids ready for school in the morning and took them to the bus stop. I played with the baby, made him food, put him down for a nap. Then waited for the kids to come back. I\u00a0 have a clean\u00a0 drivers license, my own\u00a0 car and CPR certified. I make sure I'm paying close attention to the\u00a0 kids and make sure that they are safe at all times. i can also help out with some house work if needed like clean up toys, tidy the bedrooms, children's Landry and wash dishes. Also i can help with baths and bedtime.\u00a0 I don't smoke or drink and i have a clean background check . I am available Wednesdays from aytime in the morning til 230pm and Thursday-Saturday all day. I can also provide you with references from my previous and current babysitting job. \nThank you."

I understand feeling discouraged when you don\u2019t get any job offers because I feel the same way. However, there are a lot of applicants on this website daily, and these families have a bunch of applications to sort through.. I\u2019ve seen as many as 40 or 50 applications on 1 job! I can\u2019t imagine sifting through all that!! It must be overwhelming. So, what I do is: A) try to remind myself daily that these families get a lot of applications, and B) make sure I keep an eye out for jobs with a low number of applicants and apply to those first. I don\u2019t know if my approach is a good one because I\u2019m still searching for work, but that\u2019s what I do. Hope this helps!"

If you text back-and-forth through care.com, then have a phone interview with them through care.com, and get their last name and address before your in person interview, this can\u2019t happen. No client has ever had my last name or address until I\u2019ve been to an in person interview, been made an offer of the job and accepted their terms. Then I google them, their address, look for them on Facebook, etc, to make sure they\u2019re \u201creal\u201d.

	"text": "Okay. Diana! :) Your main issue is that you have no reviews and no \"cared for\" families on your profile. That coupled with not having a background check is a tough combination. Parents are VERY skeptical of getting someone from online so you have to make them feel comfortable about their choice. Reviews and a background check are excellent ways to do that. I'd honestly say until those are addressed it's going to pretty hard to receive messages from families.\n\nBut have no fear! :) I see that you have \"cared for children almost all your life.\" Excellent! Hopefully those are in settings where you are able to ask the parents to leave you reviews. If all else fails just ask your friends and families to leave you a few. If you get 3 reviews you are on your way to getting a carepro badge on your profile(there are a few more additional criteria to get that badge. Definitely look into what they are. When all else fails Google is your best friend.\n\nGreat job on going premium! You should definitely utilize that to see if people are looking at your \"stats\". If they are after you have spruced up your profile with some stellar reviews definitely feel free to reach out to those families that ARE viewing your profile. They don't even have to have a current job posted.\n\nYour profile doesn't specify what your education is. If you don't have a college degree no worries. It IS something many families look out for, but it should be fairly easy to work with if you are able to garner those great reviews from families you have helped in the past.\n\nIt says you are looking for part-time. Make sure the hours in your calendar align with the hours of the optimal jobs that you want even if that is not your \"availability\" for that date. Families are looking for long-term what is your availability if you are looking for a part-time nanny role not what is her availability today.\n\nBio....\n\nYou also should look into getting CPR and First Aid Certified"

	"text": "Karen, have you asked the family why they need your SSN?  Do they need it because they plan on claiming a childcare credit on their taxes? If so, they need to have their accountant or  a payroll company handle the tax aspect for you. They need to withhold taxes and pay taxes.  If they want to claim the childcare credit, you can obtain a TIN (tax identification number) from the IRS. That way they wouldn't have your SSN. If they want your SSN to do a background check, they can request it through Care, then they wouldn't have access to your SSN. You should find out what their plans are regarding the tax situation, because by law, you are considered a household employee (W-4/W-2), not an independent contractor (1099). I think you already know some of these facts, so I apologize for too much information. You and your employer could benefit from reading Publication 926, Household Employer's Tax Guide. Maybe Rachael can chime in with any info. I may have left out. Btw, you're right. You are not 1099. That would be consider tax evasion on their part. I hope this helps. \nBest,\n\ud83d\ude0aKelly"

	"text": "Hi Kodi,\n\nIf a family winces at the thought of you speaking to their former employee(s) then they're probably not worth your time. Chances are, they might be employers from hell because if they weren't, they wouldn't pass on an opportunity to have their previous nanny sing their praises. You're interviewing parents as much as they're interviewing you, so kudos  to you for bringing up the subject during your interviews. \n\nOne thing I would suggest though is to avoid using the word \"reference\" and instead ask them if it's okay to speak with their previous nanny. A lot of caregivers don't ask to do this, so some parents might be thrown off guard when you bring it up especially if you use the word \"reference\". So, it's imperative that you explain your reasoning so that they will understand where you are coming from. In general, caregivers don't get to run background checks on prospective employers, so the least we can do and should do is to look them up and of course ask to speak with a previous employees. Our safety, well being and happiness matters too... don't let anyone tell you otherwise!\n\nBest,\nUchechukwu"

	"text": "It hasn't been an issue with most people I have worked for. I worked for one family for a year and a half where the mother worked from home and I was surprised at how smoothly it went, because she told me from the beginning that when I am there what I say goes. And she made sure her children knew that, too. I have always thrived with families who I feel appreciate and trust that I can do my job and that makes me want to do the best job I can. I had an interview over the summer with a family where I felt there was a level of distrust from the start. The mother kept mentioning safety being of upmost importance- not in terms of injuries but with child abductions. Even after they spoke with all of my references and my references told me that the mother seemed nervous and wanted to know things like if I would have trouble \"doing things their way\" and the references had nothing but very good things to say about the differences I had made in their child's lives, these potential parents still did not seem convinced. They wanted to run two separate background checks on me (so they could compare and make sure everything lined up). I'm always fine with a background check but two seemed absurd. So when they told me they had cameras everywhere so they could \"check on me\" it was just one of a bunch of red flags that these people were not going to be trusting of anyone with their children. I just wrote them and flat out told them this. I've been doing this a long time and I have learned that being honest is just the best way to go even if it makes for an uncomfortable conversation. Not saying anything usually makes things worse. I think it's dishonest that a parent would not be upfront with you from the start and let you know that they would be working from home and that there would be cameras. In many states a person has to legally be told if they are being watched by cameras. I don't know that I would bring that up first, but if I was in your place I would maybe start with a conversation about how you feel more comfortable working in homes where the parents are not there because it is too difficult to have autonomy in decision making with them around. It absolutely is something that should have been disclosed. I do work part time after school now with a family where both parents are home quite often and although they are really great, nice people, it is very difficult for me to get the children to put their backpacks away and get off their iPads because the parents are right there and even though the parents want these things, too, they don't enforce the rules and the kids know that they can get away with it. I'm going to have to have another conversation with them about where my place is and how they want me to handle it. If it was up to me those iPads would be put up and they would not get them at all until all backpacks and shoes had been put away and anything else that needed done, and after that they would be timed (like a half hour). I've had conversations already with them but will have to have another. It's just best to be honest, I guess. Good luck with everything. Also, there are so many families needing care. I used to worry about speaking up because I might not find something else. But there are other families, and I refuse to work in any home anymore where I am not appreciated or can't do my job."

I was available and could help her. We had decided to set something up the following weekend and we were in good shape.

I was already a little concerned based on the conversations and the child\u2019s behavior but I still wanted to help. When I said that I was not going to send a picture, she was upset and didn\u2019t understand the importance of my privacy. She wasn\u2019t recalling any information I already told her and was quite rude. I never exchanged any foul language or disrespected her. She ended up leaving a review saying my other reviews were untruthful and that I was being ridiculous. I don\u2019t mean to toot my own horn or be rude to anyone, but I am a very good babysitter and I simply didn\u2019t want to take a picture of it because once it is out there, you can never get it back. \n\nI am not really looking for sympathy but I\u2019m just sharing one of the many crazy stories I have.

Best of luck in your search!\" I logged back in to find a reply for her asking \"it's cause of the hours right? That's why you won't work with me?\" I attempted to respond to her, but she had already blocked me! In addition, she left a 1-star review on my profile, saying \"knows.\" I am very disappointed that the care.com staff was unable to edit this issue, and they told me the best that I could do was post a rebuttal on the comment (which in my opinion is more unprofessional). \n\nAside, I just want to agree with you that care.com should put slightly more effort into equality between caregivers and parents, etc. I have encountered many negative experiences with families (not paying me, witnessing unhealthy attitudes/actions, etc) and wished I was able to warn others about such encounters! Additionally, I think it would be nice to have the same standards applied to parents in regards to background checks. I have unknowingly entered the house of families who I  may avoided, had I known up front some of their past convictions.

	"text": "Hello! Happy new year! \nI am not sure if you live in another state when you said you are moving back home. But, depending on your location, some areas have high demands for nannies and you should definitely find out where because you don\u2019t want to go to an area where the demand is scarce. You can sign up on so many different websites, have an outstanding profile (there are many posts regarding this if you can spend some times reading them) with 3 reviews by sending your links to your people to start with, add a background check plus premium or membership to boost you up as a beginner. But, keep in mind that the competition is harsh. There are other highly qualified applicants with Masters and P.H.D degrees. Being a nanny is not an easy job and it\u2019s totally different from babysitting and most nannies make less on an hourly rate than sitters. If that is what you truly one, you can start babysitting varying from short hours (3hrs) to long ones (12hrs) in a day with different families from here and there until you are fully confident to switch to nannying. Your rate should always based on your location, experiences, education, certifications, number of kids and what the job entails. Keep in mind to not mix childcare with pet care and housekeeping because these 3 are separated jobs and mostly you will be low balled if you agree to them. If you want to drive kids to activities, charge the parents the irs rate of 58 cents per mileage to cover wears, tears and gas for your care no matter what! Nannies need to file for taxes, and the parents need to sign you up for a w4 and then give you a W2 at the end of January. You can find out more by checking out Homepay which is a method for taking care of your payroll and care has one on their profile if you go to your account and settings you will see it under more. Also get a contract about parents being respectful of your time, paid on time, paid vacation or holidays or sick days...Definitely do a lot of research before choosing which career path you what to pursue or if you want to do both. It\u2019s your call and nobody else\u2019s. It doesn\u2019t matter whether your parents or friends agree to it or not. This is your own life and you have to make the best decision for yourself. Keep in mind that you will always have some roadblocks no matter whatever career you will choose. Unfortunately it\u2019s a part of growing up as an adult. Life is only for the strong and if it gets hard, you need to still get it together and pull yourself from it instead of being in denials or giving up or switching to something else or trying to get married as if it will make things better. At some points you need to stop \u270b\ud83c\udffe and face your own reality, Good luck and happy new year!"

That background check is separate from the background checks that the families request. The CareCheck is only for Care purposes and remains as a badge on your profile to show that you've had it done. \n\nIf a prospective employer wants you to do a background check or a motor vehicle check, let them request it through Care, then it will be at their cost, not yours. They will have access to those results. \n\nIf you don't have any reviews, ask past employers, family, and friends to post reviews for you. Reviews can help you stand out and give the families a peek into your character, work ethic, and how well you work with children."

I contacted this woman nearly two weeks ago cause her hours aligned with mine. We did a phone interview a week ago and she mentioned she wants to meet with me in person and would get back to me this week but hasn\u2019t? She\u2019s also interviewing other people (understandable) and also wants to do a background check if I\u2019m the one she hires (understandable) but she\u2019s taking so long with the hiring process. At this rate I\u2019m going on week 3 and unfortunately I haven\u2019t applied for other jobs on here as they don\u2019t really align with my schedule. So what should I do? I already had to message her once on my own and she said she would be getting back to me in a day or two but it\u2019s been 4 days nows. I\u2019m starting to get a little frustrated as I feel like I\u2019ve just wasted my time trying to reach out and see where this is going. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"

Since there are many jobs in your areas, note that you are competing with other highly qualified candidates as well and parents will look at your biography, education, experiences, certifications, your age, distance from them and much more. Make sure to have an outstanding profile with proper spelling, syntax, grammar (you can find more information by checking out some previous posts on how to land some gigs). If you can afford a premium, I suggest you upgrade for a one month to 3 months trial. It comes with a free Motor vehicle record check (in case you can\u2019t afford the background check), you can reply to any parents back and forth, you will get a daily morning alerts to apply for jobs ahead of non premium members, you can look at your stats to see if parents are viewing your profile and you will also appear on the top search list from parents. If you can get 3 reviews from the people you worked with, respond to all of your messages within 24hrs, add a debit card on file with the motor vehicle record badge on file, you will get a Carepro status which can boost you up more. But please keep in mind that none of these will guarantee you a job especially if jobs are rare/competitive in your area but it\u2019s best to always have those advantages because we never know. The premium did help me compared to when I didn\u2019t have it. Yes, some people can still get a job without it but it\u2019s different for everyone depending on some factors i mentioned above. Keep on applying and be patient. Good luck!"

It was not a full background check, just confirmation that you are who you say you are so that they know you\u2019re not a scammer.

I only found 3 occasional families this year and it\u2019s been 4 years i have been trying to land gigs in here with no lucks knowing that I had a premium and applied for more than 50 jobs daily.   4. Yes, many. The mobile site, desktop site and the app are very different from each other. Each one has at least 2 features that are missing from others which makes it hard for someone who didn\u2019t get a chance to explore everything to know where to go for what he/she is looking. Jobs get expired and they are still on the job board. It\u2019s hard to know if you applied to a job unless you select it and see that it says applied. Maybe Care should have a list of applied jobs to make things easier. Moreover, they can have a list of hidden jobs so that you can put all of the jobs that you are not interested about (low rate, time conflict...) over there. It doesn\u2019t make sense that they still sit there on the job board, it gets over crowded. Additionally, sitters/nannies need to have the premium in order to be able to reply to all parents which is ridiculous because I know a website where caregivers don\u2019t have to pay a dime for anything. Their background check is less than $19.99 for a whole year. In here it\u2019s too expensive for the background check and the monthly fees. Also, you don\u2019t get an email and alert once a parent had confirmed the hours that you worked for which is very confusing. They should let you know that the parent paid and it\u2019s pending (even if you go to booking, it\u2019s still unclear), a list of transaction should be a must. Additionally, it\u2019s hard to have your messages for the parents that booked or interviewed you in one place compared to the messages that you left when expressing an interest in a job. Everything goes into one long message. I have to always scroll down passed more than 50 messages (from the jobs that I expressed in) to get to the name of one of my occasional families to tel them something. The website designer is jut horrible at his/her job, everything is disorganized smh \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.  Some parents will ask your number I always tell them to send me their bookings/interview request and that once I receive it and confirmed, we\u2019ll see each other phone number and addresses. A 3 min video should be sent to parents and caregivers about the proper way of being in touch with each other and navigating through the website and how to get gigs because many people don\u2019t know that you need at least 3 reviews, update your calendar, make sure your biography stands out, put a picture and a videos, set at least a minimum rate for every parent ($17/hr) no matter where you are, below which you can\u2019t book a caregiver. Care payment doesn\u2019t work with the app. You have to use the website to confirm the hours. Also, parents can\u2019t book you on a 15min increment like 8:15am to 9:15 it has to be 8:00am to 9:00am \ud83d\ude02\nFinally, parents should have a background check and caregivers should rate them as well."

Make sure you discuss the days, hours, duties that will be expected of you, how they will handle taxes, will you be transporting the children in your car, and please be sure to get a contract with the family. You can discuss your payrate, PTO, and mileage reimbursement of 57.5\u00a2 per mile after you both decide you want to move forward with the hiring process. At that time, you can also give them your references and agree to a background check that they can request from care.com (that way it will be at their expense, not yours). Relax and have fun.

	"text": "Hi Joe, my name is Sam and I am a caregiver living in Ann Arbor, MI. I have some tips, pointers, tricks of the trade, etc. on being given further consideration for childcare positions.  I was in the same boat as you when I first started back in 2012 and as Christine said, there\u2019s a certain prejudice on parents being uncomfortable with male caregivers but conversely, there are families that have a stronger preference for a male role model for a number of reasons like two mom families, single moms, child(ren) specifically asking for \u201cboy babysitters,\u201d and others.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many applications you\u2019ll submit before you\u2019re given further consideration and finding the right fit; I lost count on the number of unsuccessful attempts before finding my first gig. Starting fresh is going to be very challenging but with persistence, you will prevail.  I\u2019m living proof that male caregivers can succeed in an otherwise competitive industry.\n\nSteps you can take to improve the odds on being given further consideration are as follows:\n\n1. Clean up your profile \u2014your care.com account/profile is a business profile advertising a service so make it appear like one as you highlight skills, experience, certifications (if any), education (if applicable), and miscellaneous relevant details.  Check for proper spelling, grammar, and overall presentation/flow; parents want a positive role model for their child(ren) that is a well spoken, reliable, and a good influence that conforms to high professional standard.\n\n2. Strong First Impression\u2014Just like your profile, your letter of application is going to be the first impression you make to prospective new family so make an effort to sell yourself and stand out above the competition as you highlight your skills and experience, acknowledge what the family is seeking (desired qualities and associated responsibilities, days and times needed, etc.), and a strong communicator. As before, double check proper spelling, grammar and overall flow presentation.\n\n3. Resume \u2014Having a resume shows you are serious about services you have to offer.  One little trick I found very helpful is creating a resume as a pdf/word doc on google docs, and including the link in my letter of application.  \n\n4. Background Check \u2014You say you have a clean background and MVR record; is it available on your care.com profile?  If not, I would recommend exploring possibility as it is a big scale tipper in your favor.  \n\n5. References/Reviews \u2014This is another major scale tipper.  For any families you worked for in the past (friends, family, neighbors, etc.), having solid references will make a difference.  Maybe some of them would be willing to write a review on your profile and improve your odds even further.  When I got my first job with a family, I had no reviews on my profile; the only things I had going for me were references they could contact, making a strong first impression in my letter of application and a professionally worded profile.  As I got to work with more families and accumulate reviews, it was considerably easier to be given further consideration for variety of positions in different capacities (part-time, full time, ad-hoc, alternate back-up, live in, etc.).  \n\nAdditional details to evaluate under advisement is the job postings open in your area: it\u2019s pretty easy to distinguish families that are serious about committing to a service vs. families that aren\u2019t 100% certain based on details displayed. If you see words like:\n\u201cAble to handle pickups/drop offs,\u201d\n\u201cOur family loves playing games/sports so we hope you do too!\u201d\n\u201c Comfortable with pets\u201d and many generic sounding sentences, don\u2019t waste your time because those families checked off boxes and had a robot generated sentence with no substance because they don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re looking for.  Instead, look at postings with specific details on desired qualities of ideal caregiver, days and times needed, responsibilities, and overall a structured/official looking flow.  Limit your applications to families that have a picture AND clearly outlined needs; the rest aren\u2019t worth the time of day.\n\nMale caregivers may be the minority but that doesn\u2019t make you any less important.  I used to volunteer at a shelter for survivors and their children of domestic violence as a playroom supervisor and my fellow male colleagues did an amazing job interacting with the kids so don\u2019t let the biases/prejudices get to you.\n\nIf you have further questions and wish to discuss further, leave a response in the comments and I\u2019ll respond as promptly as possible during breaks in workflow.\n\nCheers!"

	"text": "The steps you\u2019ve taken thus far are certainly leaning in the right direction: proper spelling and grammar will make a strong positive first impression for a potential employer.  Having a background check on file is a big scale tipper; it shows you are serious about the services you have to offer.  Highlighting skills and experience shapes your profile into a business bio since that\u2019s what it is.\n\nAdding pictures definitely is icing on the cake; it gives people an idea on who you are and what you\u2019re like.\n\nI might suggest including unique qualities about yourself that sets you apart from other caregivers; signature techniques/skills/styles that you\u2019ve developed as you worked with kids.\n\nAnother major scale tipper is feedback, reviews and references on your profile.  If there are any families that can submit feedback with an active care.com membership, try asking for a review for past work performed.  Another step you can take is list contact info for references on your profile and what ends up happening is a representative from care.com contacts reference by phone, records the call, and quotes/paraphrases positive comments said about you.  \n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many applications you\u2019ll submit before getting a response so keep at it; you also have to remember that in order for them to respond through care.com messaging, at least one member in exchange must have premium upgrade to account. I suggest including an e-mail address you\u2019re comfortable sharing in your letter of application."

There\u2019s no way anyone I\u2019ve ever babysat for would allow their child to be in a Rental apartment with a boyfriend that they didn\u2019t have a background check on. do you have CPR and first aid or any other qualifications/ certifications that would really matter to a parent? Make sure your apps are specific and well written since most parents will want you to teach their children proper English and help with homework."

I have the education and experience but apart from that I also pay for CPR, First Aid, Premium Account here on care, background check, motor vehicle check, and I also bring supplies (crafts and educational activities). I factor in everything. I charge more for children under 1years because they require much more work (diapers and bottles). The best part about this type of work, you set your own rate. You\u2019re the boss and if parents aren\u2019t interested, move on. Cleaning favors soon turn into required duties so I avoid all the extras. Strictly child care ONLY!! Overtime, prices increase on everything... so increase yours based on your needs. Never feel bad for wanting more. You deserve it!"

If you can pay for premium. It's kinda necessary for messaging, it boosts your stats, and you get a vehicle background check included in the price. Use the promo code CARESAVE for 20% off (I think?). I pay for 1 month at a time because if I get a job in that first month, I cancel my premium subscription. It does remove my background check, which is annoying, but I print it off to have in case my current family requests it.\n\n2. Make your application peppy and personal. Families want to see that you're excited to work with them. I start with \"Hello!\", add the phrase \"Here is a little bit more about me\" before diving into my credentials, and close it out with \"Your family sounds awesome and I would love the chance to work with you, even if it's just as a date night sitter!\" and always, always thank them for their time!\n\n3. Take an extra 5 minutes to personalize your application. Do they want someone with a car? If you have one say so! Do they want someone who can also tutor in math and you've helped kids with math before? Mention it! Half the time people are only looking at your application and not your profile, so list things like CPR training, skills, and whether or not you have a car. I have a base application saved and I add things specific to each application.\n\n4. Mention things other than childcare! They are bringing you into their family and want to know you! Talk about your hobbies. I mention that I like hiking, crafting, and science. It makes a huge difference and you seem like a more well-rounded person\n\nI hope this helps!"

	"text": "Hey Chelsea! I\u2019m usually very positive but please think this through. You want to hire someone without knowing their rate and without them knowing how much you\u2019re willing to pay to care for your daughter. That\u2019s problem one because no caregiver will do this. Problem two, you\u2019re going to leave your daughter at home with a complete stranger and expect them to \u201cget her dressed\u201d and on the school bus. You do not know this individual but you\u2019re going to leave your child with them? Are you going to atleast interview someone? Also you\u2019re asking your daughter to be comfortable with a stranger being in her home with her. Her home is hopefully her safe place and by bringing in someone she\u2019s never met could really upset her. Problem three, you want this person to work for two weeks without pay so that you do not lose your job. I\u2019m sorry that you do not have adequate childcare but to ask a complete stranger to trust that you\u2019re going to pay them in two weeks is very off putting! I\u2019m not saying you\u2019re not trustworthy, but most caregivers aren\u2019t going to be okay with this especially if they take into consideration what you wrote above. \n\nThere\u2019s so many red flags in your post that I hope you\u2019ll rethink this. You will need to:\nA) Interview and find a qualified caregiver.\nB) Try to find a caregiver that has a background check already on file so that you can look at their record.\nC) Find the time today to check the persons references or you can use the ones on care.com if you believe them to be adequate.  D) Find a way to compensate your caregiver starting today. It\u2019s not realistic to ask someone to work for two weeks without pay especially when in your post it seems as though you do not have the funds to pay them. \n\nAnywho good luck with your search! P.S previous posters are correct. This is a discussion board so you will need to post a job on the main website. I would honestly revise your message before doing so."

HOWEVER  - Before Covid-19, I got more inquiries from parents scanning caregiver profiles than responses to applications (1 to 3 unsolicited inquiries per month).  I keep my background check current, respond quickly to every inquiry, and ask my families to write a thorough review rather than just clicking thestar rating. Here's a tip that helped me:  Create a 'parent' account using an alternate email address. Look at what parents see when they're searching. Check out the other Nannies in your \"dummy\" search results to compare/contrast against your current profile."

	"text": "I made this post to highlight few things that you can try to improve if you are still trying to look for jobs. I am tired of hearing some people saying they can\u2019t find a job, it\u2019s a scam, how long will it take to be hired, is the premium worth it .....\n\n    1) Your ability to find a job will depend on your LOCATION, EDUCATION, CERTIFICATIONS, EXPERIENCES... what the job entails, the number of kids, your rate.....\n  2) PROFILE: the way you present yourself, should speak more about your qualifications. The app doesn\u2019t have all of the features, so your best bet it to use the website on the \u201cdesktop site\u201d to finish of what you started. Your biography should stand out and talk about what I mentioned on 1). Add a professional picture, a 20s video too. Parents also love to know what else you are currently doing beside being a caregiver and the activities you are willing to do/bring in.\n  3) REVIEWS help a lot even if it\u2019s 1 or 2. You can share your profile link to someone you worked with (even outside of care) to help you started.\n  4) PREMIUM: A premium member ($20/mo or $50/6mo) will provide you with morning emails to go apply for jobs ahead of those that don\u2019t have if, so you can be among the top applicants. It comes with a FREE motor vehicle record check. Having a background check ($33) done is separate from the premium perks. Also, you get to reply to parents back and forth and if you add a debit card on file, 3 reviews & all of those can boost you up to a CAREPRO status to increase your chances. As long as you are a premium member, parent can send you an automated message by declining you as a candidate and you can renew both of your background checks at anytime for free.\n  5) CALENDAR: this is something that many people forget. Always add your availabilities to your calendar. It\u2019s based on a 4 weeks timeframe. You can go back to it each Sunday to add more availability as the weeks go by.\n 6) RESPONSE: to get a respond from a parent, you may wanna apply to many jobs even if it\u2019s 50 days per day. Keep in mind that parents are not obliged to respond to anyone at all and you are competing with many qualified applicants as well and they cannot always get back to all 50+ persons. They might even forget to close the job or decline your offer, but you need to keep on applying.\n7)  FAMILIES: when a family reach out to you, always welcome them first, then go back to the applications above to refresh your memory (sometimes they edit the jobs but you won\u2019t get any alerts about it). Ask them about the days, hours (start and end time), mention your rate (stick to it and never go below your worth or at least the minimum hourly wage of your state. No flat rate!), the irs rate of 57.5 cents per mileage of driving their kids around on your own car is a must to cover gas, wears and tears, what the job entails, & talk about your expectations. If it sounds ok, then schedule a phone interview first before meeting up in person. This will save you a lot of times, efforts and bad reviews.\n8) COMMUTE: Always think about how you will get to your job. Is it worth it driving/public transportation for 2hours to get to 2hours shift where you will be making less than $50 in total or spend more on your round trip than what you will be earning? Traffic can be jammed, road blocked, snow days...\n9) FIRST DAY: when you have been fully hired, please before you go there, make sure you have had done some trials to see if it will be a good fit or not, signed a contract (guarantee hours, paid on time, cancelation fees...). I think you can get a sample on google but Racheal mentioned there nannnycounsel.com has a great one. They must enrolled you with Homepay on care of their accountant, so that you can fill out your W4 and get a W2 at the end of the year. DO NOT WORK under the table.\n10) LEAVING: when things are not working out anymore, I am a big fun of communication and that is where you have to start talking and not wait until things get out of control. Are you being underpaid? Disrespected? Overworked than agreed on? Deserve a rate? New contract? .... SPEAK UP In person or/and send a group message as a reminder for x,y &Z. If none of that work, you may wanna quit or give a 2 weeks notice depending on your circumstances.\n\nFinally, it takes times, efforts and some small investments to land a job. Use your time to fully explore each website (app doesn\u2019t show much) that you are on. Read about the facts, check out previous topics discussed on this platform, look around and learn for yourself. Be patient, optimistic and you will be fine. There is no instant job anywhere in this world. You gotta work for it to get it! Hopefully, I didn\u2019t strike a nerves on anyone. Thank you so much for your time! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nP.S: We do have a Facebook group \u201c All4One Caregivers\u201d in case you want to meet some caregivers in your areas to connect with ... Feel free to join us!"

I can\u2019t see how Care can compete with that if they don\u2019t do the same. If I were seeking care, I wouldn\u2019t keep paying for multiple background checks on here if there are sites that offer checks on all caregivers...or if I could pay a one time fee for an agency to find a nanny which they\u2019ve background checked."

When I said no, they asked, \u201cat all? ever?\u201d I said, \u201cwell, I have an occasional drink at family functions or when I\u2019m out to dinner with my husband.\u201d They then told me that could be a problem! I didn\u2019t even know how to respond to that. I work in a prestigious private school for goodness sake and they never even asked me that type of question! They just ran a thorough background check on me, which reflects that I am a law-abiding, responsible human being. I have daughters who are 15 and 9...I babysit on the side and have been for 5 years now, we\u2019ve had babysitters ourselves. I could have cared less what perfectly legal activities those babysitters participated in in their spare time. As long as they weren\u2019t drinking and smoking around my children or in my house. Perhaps I\u2019m a bit desensitized to all this, as my grandmother who babysat me constantly growing up, was a smoker (she quit about 15 years ago) and now that I\u2019m older, I know she drinks (but not when she\u2019s babysitting.) When they saw my confused reaction, they said they had an \u201cissue\u201d with a previous sitter. I get that, and I\u2019d be pretty angry if a sitter was getting drunk around my kids, but I wouldn\u2019t disqualify someone who drinks a glass of wine every now and then. \ud83d\ude44\n\nSo anyway, since Care only runs background checks on us and not the parents, I googled them...came across their Facebook pages...and guess what?

I also don\u2019t like that they monitor and prevent or try to prevent me from sending my email and my cell number. I am a responsible adult....the email that I use is not my primary email and my cell number is not the same as a landline.  And I do not speak with anyone on the phone before they contact me in another way."

I helped take care of him, gave him his medicine, cleaned the house, cooked him dinner as well as my mom and my little sister. My sister is 9 years younger than I am and I always helped take care of her as well for most of her life. I graduated high school and I moved out and started going to college at ASU. I babysat a lot of her friends and other neighborhood children when I was still in high school. The children I babysat ranged from 6 months old to 12 years old. I also recently worked at a private preschool with children from 2 years old to 5 years old and with 8 to 13 children on my own. I have never had a complaint from any parent or employer and I have great references. I also have my fingerprint clearance card and can do a background check if needed. I am looking for a weekend babysitting job or even date nights."

	"text": "Hi Tatiana, I've had a great experience with Care. Here's what I suggest:\n- Purchase the premium membership. You don't have to purchase it, but by purchasing the premium membership you will appear higher in the search results, notified when there are new jobs in your area, and you'll be able to messages families whether or not they have the premium membership. \n- Purchase the Criminal+MVR background checks. You don't have to purchase the background checks, but most families will ask for them. If the family requests a background check, you can ask them to request it through Care and ask if they will incur the expense. The last family I had requested a background check and the company he worked for paid for it. \n- Compose a clear and informative profile/bio. Have all of your information filled out (the schedule you're interested in, duties you're willing to do, pay rate, etc.). \n- Ask past employers, family, and friends to post reviews for you. Believe it or not, the reviews do help. \n- Apply to as many jobs as you can. Be patient. Sometimes the families sort through several applications, so it may take hours, days, or weeks to sort through them and decide which caregivers the will speak to and interview. \n- Respond quickly to incoming messages. If you don't, the family may move on to the next caregiver. \nThere is so much information and advice out there. I hope this little bit will help you. Good luck!\nBest, \nKelly \ud83d\ude0a"

MANY of them ask for birth month and day, but not the year.  They like to send customers some kind of incentive in their birth month as their way of saying happy birthday.  How many times do you have to verify the \"last four\" of your social,  for a bank or possibly credit card company.  Only if you initiated the phone call, you give it to them not even questioning who exactly is asking. As far as someone seeing the teeth of my background check,  I have absolutely no problem.  It's as clean as a whistle .\nAs for your motor vehicle record,  it does show the last 4 of your drivers driver's license number,  which I have no problem with.  It also shows when your license expires--something very important to a prospective family. I do NOT  give access to my background check to everyone that I apply to, I give access to those I set up an interview with AND I take a hard copy to the interview. Along with copies of my reviews on care.com AND copies of ALL of my reference letters. \n\nAs for finding out about the family,  I think the only thing that you can do is ask to speak to previous nannies and I'm not sure who else.  I wouldn't expect them to disclose their SSN, birthdates or any other information to a \"potential employee \".  Maybe it's just me  but I tend to go with my gut after the interview and I will \"know\" if it's would be a good fit or not. Maybe I'm too trusting,  but families are not big corporations that you can go online & research.  Just my thoughts."

	"text": "I'm really afraid they'll get on here and find this post. There were many red flags from the beginning. They hired me with no interview! I didn't understand why on earth anyone would do that. By all means it was a legitimate job, but oddly, the hiring agency had NO reviews on Glassdoor. I did find the school I worked for on Glassdoor and the reviews were so bad, I was scared. Still, I was dying to get out of the customer service field and get back into education, which I felt was a better match.\n\nI have a masters degree and a fair amount of teaching experience. They required their own background check and this included fingerprinting. I had to pay for it, but that's normal for contract positions. Now this also was odd...they had me sign the contract and THEN they sent the application. I had no clue why they had hired me and never even spoken to me, had not yet checked my references, etc. Now also they wanted to know about some job I worked over 30 years ago and insisted on contacting them. I doubt they kept records from that far back! They also wanted to contact my last job, which wasn't related to children at all. I wasn't too thrilled about that, but I think they liked me.\n\nAnyway, I was told that what I would be doing would be supporting the students and acting as an advocate. After about a week into the job I started realizing that this wasn't what the school wanted. The school expected me to police the kids, and this was for liability reasons. One of the school personnel shocked me when she told me, over the phone, \"He might be out robbing a bank and if that happens, the school is responsible, so you have to make sure he's in class.\" Oh come on! They were treating the kids like juvenile delinquents. It was so disgusting! The school was also very rigid in their thinking. After a while I realized that this school wasn't in the business of educating, not at all, but in the business of keeping the kids out of trouble. Only.\n\nThe first week wasn't too bad, even though I had my doubts. The last week on the job was hell. Every day, when I finished, I found myself in tears over how badly they were treating the kids. On Friday I finally called my friend and bawled my eyes out. She said it wasn't a matter of whether I would quit, but when I would quit. She said I could stick it out another week, gather as much dirt on them as possible, then, expose them somehow. Right after that, when I was still drying my tears (and kind of embarrassed about crying on phone) the agency called me up and fired me.\n\nI guess they didn't like that I cared about the kids. They didn't want kindness. I refused to be a policewoman and that pissed them off. I'm proud that I was canned. I'm proud that I have a good sense of right and wrong and refuse to take orders when I don't believe in what I am doing.\n\nI'm so fed up with kissing employers' butts that at this point, I'm going to start my own business. I don't think I want to work for a school again, certainly not a cyber school. They treat kids terribly these days. I don't blame the kids for hating school. I did not like it when I was a kid either. I did not like the rules and I did not hesitate to say so. I loved college, though. It was voluntary, after all, my choice to study hard and do well, and I'm awfully glad I did.\n\nIs there any way you folks know of to report this school? I have written to the governor, written to my state rep and so far, no response. They really should be concerned because the school was putting the kids on Medicaid and then, milking it. I found out other stuff, too. Lawsuits, etc. i'm trying to contact the state Board of Ed also."

They have each received my initial application and a follow up email from me, but still all I hear are crickets when it comes to those applications. Long story short.....once you have sent your application there is nothing you can do but wait.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been with care.com for just over two years. Every job I have found has been through them, with the exception of one. I have worked for six great families. Each had different needs as far as childcare. All were short term\u2014the shortest 6 weeks the longest being almost 7 months. I specialize in newborn and infant care. All have been first time parents except one. They are either looking someone to care for their new baby until their daycare spot opens up, or until the baby is a certain age and then they go into daycare, and one family I cared for their newborn for about 3 months while the mom was ending her time in the military and going through whatever it takes for processing out. I am at premium status because I feel that little bit of investment in myself has paid for itself.i also keep my background check and MVR report up to date, I also believe that helps in getting hired\u2014- by having it in hand when applying for a job.\n\nJust know that you are definitely not the only one."

	"text": "When I was 15 my family tried commercial fishing for a summer. The small community heard I did babysitting and some parents hired me. They asked me to come over to their camp trailer where they were renting a space at about 4am. They said the 3 young kids, whom I had never met would be asleep and to crawl into bed with one and stay until the parents came back. These kids had never seen me and wake up to a total stranger! It was pretty cozy really with the glow of the heater and we just exchanged eye contact and smiles and then the parents returned. \n\nFast forward to one of my recent families. I applied on Indeed for a classroom 1:1 aid for a child with behavior issues. The former aide had just moved away and they wanted someone else immediately. Now, I do feel like I\u2019m generally a good interview, but this parent talked to me on the phone, never asked to meet me and hired me on the spot! No application, no references, no background check and this is at a private school. I didn\u2019t meet the parent for about a week! I realize she probably relied on the school for judge of character, but they didn\u2019t even do any sort of background check! I\u2019m still there and the child and I have bonded from day one. Sometimes she tells me she still misses the last aide but that\u2019s usually when she\u2019s mad at me because I expect more of her."

In my experience with agencies (I've worked with 3 in 2 different cities) you do an interview and background check, then you have access to the job board that you can look at and apply to positions. What's nice is that they help you through the whole process and are really looking to match you with the best fit  It's based on what people are looking for and usually it is more full time but I have seen many part time postings, too. I don't work more than 30ish hours bc I'm also a freelance illustrator but in my experience it's across-the-board as far as full-time or part-time, you just gotta get in with them and keep looking bc obvs it changes all the time.\n My unicorn family came from an agency and generally the families I got through agencies really valued me and I am still in touch with them.... there's no harm in getting set up with an agency bc it's no commitment until you do take a. Job. The ones I was with the rule was you had to stay with the family for a year minimum if you still wanted representation after that. But the benefits and pay are worth it to me. Best of luck!"

Apply to as many jobs as you can, all that fit your needs and schedule. Be patient, because it may take time for the families to sort through the many applications they receive and decide which caregivers they will interview. Ask past employers, friends, and family to post reviews for you. The reviews will give the families a sneak peek at your character, how well you work with children, and your work ethic. If you can afford it, you can choose to purchase a background check and a premium membership, but those are optional. As Kelly W. suggested, you can visit the \"topics\" area of this discussion to revisit old posts. You will find lots of information, advice, tips, and maybe a few laughs. Good luck to you!\nBest regards,\n\ud83d\ude0a Kelly K"

Now I did have one client a long time ago- that requested my ssn - but this was after going to her home and getting hire by her. I believe some ppl want it to do a background check - but I also believe some try to claim it on their taxes as well. I did give my ss to her - and work for her for a while. That was the only time I had been asked that - now if I was ask to give that info even in person I would not. It's just not worth it and is a little over kill.

Unless you feel you have enough experience to warrant $30/hr. Some parents may just pass over you simply because there's too much of a question mark about your rate. They like quick answers when possible.\n\nGreat job with premium. If you can possibly getting those people who have references from to actually type them or part of them into a review that would be much easier.\n\nPlease get CPR and First Aid trained. It's like a glaring whole at the very beginning of your profile.\n\nA background check I say just makes you look like a prepared professional.\n\nYour bio has a few minor punctuation issues. Although, just letting you know that some folks HATE semicolons. It's a thing. Especially if they've applied to med school. You can probably get the ladies of the board to help you fix your bio. Just post it and ask for help to fix it.\n\nThe 1 review that you have is actually really good. You should take advantage of your premium membership and go to your \"stats\" where you can view the families that have viewed your profile. Message some of those families and see what type of feedback you receive.\n\nJust double checking, your experience with children is 5 years? Is that correct?\n\nDefinitely fill out your availability schedule. It supposedly keeps you higher in the searches, but it also gives parents a better idea of what you are looking for. If you don't put anything, they also may bypass you for that. Easy quick answers again are sometimes what they need. \n\nThink that's it, let me know if you have any questions, Danielle. :)"

There are some fabulous sitters on here who don't speak English as their primary language, but having someone maybe proofread would be helpful, if possible. \n\n-READ the job posts. Some sitters will apply to anything and everything, whether the job is 30+ miles away, not actually available for the days and/or time frames needed, they don't have a vehicle and driving is part of the job, etc.\n\n-Don't copy and paste the summary on your profile to job posts.

In my message I said \"I'm very interested in your position, but have a few questions and would love to hear more about it!\" She responsed with \"well are you interested or not????\" I was so baffled and have had my fair share of red flags, so I kindly responded shortly after saying, \"thanks so much for the consideration this far, but I have decided to decline the position. Best of luck in your search!\" I logged back in to find a reply for her asking \"it's cause of the hours right? That's why you won't work with me?\" I attempted to respond to her, but she had already blocked me! In addition, she left a 1-star review on my profile, saying \"knows.\" I am very disappointed that the care.com staff was unable to edit this issue, and they told me the best that I could do was post a rebuttal on the comment (which in my opinion is more unprofessional). \n\nAside, I just want to agree with you that care.com should put slightly more effort into equality between caregivers and parents, etc. I have encountered many negative experiences with families (not paying me, witnessing unhealthy attitudes/actions, etc) and wished I was able to warn others about such encounters! Additionally, I think it would be nice to have the same standards applied to parents in regards to background checks. I have unknowingly entered the house of families who I  may avoided, had I known up front some of their past convictions. That being said, is there a professional way to run a background report on a family? How would one approach this situation? And is there a reason care.com is not very concerned with the safety of their nannies/sitters?"

Make sure your profile is outstanding, get couple reviews and keep on applying, you will get there. Finding a job on care can take some times. A background check is good until 6 months. But if you have the premium, you get the Motor vehicle record check for free and can renew it for free at anytime as long as you still have the premium. I am not sure if the same thing applies to the background check or not. But if you go on the website using the desktop site and act like you want to renew, you should be able to know it. My background checked expired but I still have the MVR and renew it anytime I want (no limit). If you reply to families in less than 24hrs and have a debit card on file, you can get the Carepro status which is also helpful. Premium was definitely helpful for me than not having it. You can also sign up on other websites as well to broaden your chances. Apply early mornings when you get the email from care, those are just for premium members before the rest of the caregivers can have access to it. You can check your stats too to see if parents are checking on your profile or not. Everything is on the website, spend some times on it and try to familiarize yourself with it because many features are missing from the app.\nIt\u2019s not just about having good lucks, your location, education, experiences and what you are willing to do or not along with the age matter too.

	"text": "Several posts in the past few days have mentioned that care.com is asking for their SS # in order to do a background check. I just received my notification about this today.  I don't know for sure but I assume that this new policy is because care.com has been sued on at least one occasion by families whose child was harmed by a caregiver initially contacted through care.com.  This is possibly an attempt by care.com to increase security and reduce liability. I absolutely support care.com in this effort.  I hope that eventually they will also do background checks on parents.  FYI,  I followed the care.com links related to this and found the following:\nWhat is a CareCheck?\nAs of July 2019, we have begun rolling out an enhanced caregiver screening to include a background check called a CareCheck. This process will take some time. We collect your legal name, permanent address, birth date, and Social Security Number so that our background check vendor, Sterling Talent Solutions, can run your CareCheck. There is no cost to you for the CareCheck which includes:\nSocial Security Number trace\nNational Sex Offender Public Website search\nMulti-jurisdictional criminal database search\nFederal and county criminal records search\nWhen your CareCheck is complete, your profile will display a CareCheck badge with the date that the last CareCheck was run. We ask for your patience as we work to complete this change through the remainder of this year. We expect to refresh CareChecks annually for caregivers who remain active on the Care.com platform\nWe do not run CareChecks on people looking for caregivers.\nEach of us will have to decide if this is something we can live with.  If not, understand that you will NOT be able to remain active on care.com.  Please, if you disagree with this policy, DO NOT take it out on me.  I am just the messenger and in the same situation as everyone else on this board."

Have at least 3 reviews.  You can email people you  know and they can do a personal reference.  Check site daily for new jobs.  Keep your profile updated frequently.  Try to mention any recent experience and any paid child care, nanny positions in your bio.  If you don't have any, then work on building your resume with paid experience.  I worked at a childcare for a short time.  Maybe take on a temp job, one time or occasional job just to get the paid experience and parent reviews.  Parents care about recent, paid experience, CPR cert, clear background check and education the most in my opinion.   It takes time, but just keep at it."

Most people never asked me for them in the first place although I've always had at least one written review. Honestly, if I have that rare person that asks, for a one-time job, I tell them no. I put a TON of work into getting my written references and I happen to provide A LOT of info up front. I value the time of the families that I have worked for in the past and in all likelihood they are one of my 75 reviews already. The very first gig I got on an online platform I asked for a review soon after the completed gig(and no that family never called a reference. We did meet in person though and I had a background check...I'm pretty sure) Most people stopped asking me for in person meetings and some folks didn't even need a phone cal(now it's most folks don't require a phone call, but I require it on my end), and I could be in their house the next hour.\n\nI have NOT been actively looking for a full-time position in the time that I have had so many reviews so I'm not sure if they would even ask me anymore. \n\nAlso, contact information is actually private info to me, I would NEVER give my families' phone numbers to someone I hadn't even spoken to myself yet."

	"text": "I\u2019m sorry but every time I see a post along these lines, it amazes.....astounds.....even somewhat confuses me that those that are new seem to think that if they apply for 20, 30, even 50 jobs......that they will get massive responses. This site does NOT guarantee anyone a job. They are the middle man, the intermediary, the go between.....helping those seeking childcare connect with those who are looking for a childcare position and visa versa. If you are young and have little to no experience, it\u2019s going to be very difficult to find a job. If you are a college student who can only work certain days & certain hours and that changes with each semester, it\u2019s going to be difficult to find a position. Yes, I applaud you for your hard work & dedication in getting your education, but the majority of families are looking for someone full time or part time with set days & hours. \n\nIf I\u2019ve said it once, I\u2019ve said it a hundred times.....you can apply to one hundred jobs and beyond that with the exception of a follow up message (thanking the family from accepting your application and that you look forward to hearing from them soon) there is absolutely nothing you can do. A family listing a job may get dozens of responses. They may or may not read all of them. They may skim through and pick just a few. If you are not among the chosen few, do not expect any kind of acknowledgement. In over 2.5 years and the dozens of applicants that I have put out, I have received TWO responses that basically said \u201cthank you for your application, but we have decided to go in a different direction\u201d. One of you must have premium in order for messages to go back & forth. I see so many caregivers say \u201cI\u2019m no paying for premium. I\u2019m not paying for a background check. Those are the responsibility of the employer,\u201d Did you ever stop to think the potential employers are waiting for applications thinking \u201cIt\u2019s not my responsibility to get premium or pay for a background check, if they want a job badly enough they will pay for it.\u201d  Did anyone ever think of that? And if they want a background background check on every person that they interview, even four interviews add up to over $100. If one is hired, $75 down the drain. If no one is hired $100 gone for nothing. No one seems to want to look at both sides of the coin....job seekers OR potential employers. \n\nYou can have what you believe to be the best references, experience and application.....and you can stand on your head and sing Mary had a Little Lamb until pigs fly, but there is absolutely nothing that you can do to make anyone respond to your application, in any way-shape-or form.\n\nI have applied to a job, only to see the post vanish within hours. I (right now) have an application \u201copen\u201d that I sent out March 20th for a position that was to begin October 1st. The job is still showing as open. I would put money on they have hired someone and never closed the position.  I have one that I applied for May 21st also to begin October 1st, I\u2019d bet the same happened with this one. I wish there was some way that we as caregivers could \u201cclean\u201d out our applications after say 3 to 6 months. There are problems with the site. The site is also a great tool and resource, but they make no guarantees and are not miracle workers. \n\nStepping down from my soapbox now........."

Everyone now realizes what we\u2019ve always known \u2014 caregiving is critical to families and the services you provide are an essential part of our economy.\n\nRecently, we decided to increase our level of screening for caregivers to include a background check, called a CareCheck. This safety screening is an important step in our commitment to creating a safer Care.com community. With CareCheck, families will have a safer foundation to evaluate caregivers, and caregivers will be able to find jobs more quickly to provide essential care.\n\nAs a result, in order to participate on our platform, all caregivers will be charged a $14.99 fee, which will automatically renew annually. By getting a CareCheck, you'll not only show families you're serious about safety, but you'll continue to have access to all of the same great benefits you enjoy now as a Care.com member.\n\nWe hope you\u2019ll get a CareCheck and continue using Care.com to find high-quality, well-paying jobs. On behalf of everyone at Care.com, thank you for being an important part of our caregiving community.\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\nTim Allen"

Do the same in your letters of application and acknowledge specific details in the job posting to show you have read their details.  For example, if they want someone to assist with homework after school, mention that.  \n\nThere\u2019s no telling how many applications you\u2019ll submit before landing an interview and getting an offer but it can be done.\n\nWhen I first joined care.com, I only had a basic membership and no reviews; only a clean background check and a well written profile.  Nowadays, I get families reaching out to me on a weekly basis seeking to enlist my services that I often have to turn away due to existing commitments with other families.  I\u2019ve served in a very diverse capacity including weekly recurring schedules, planned school closings, ad-hoc date nights, visitors from out of town, and even public venues for holiday events.  I am fortunate to have met and worked for the many families I have met over the years and look forward to the adventures ahead.\n\nAnother thing that might increase your odds is volunteering for a non-profit organization that involves kids; in my case, I volunteered for SafeHouse which is a non-profit organization providing shelter to survivors and their children of domestic violence and sexual assault.  My responsibilities were opening the playroom with other volunteers on premise and letting kids come to play, have fun, and be kids again for two hours (6pm-8pm).  That was the most rewarding experience ever; perhaps there\u2019s an avenue like that you can explore.\n\nHope this helps."

	"text": "Hi Emma, \nPremium membership- Not necessary, but you will only be able to communicate with the families who have purchased the premium membership. Either you or the family has to purchase the membership in order to communicate. You will also remain higher in the search results and will be notified of jobs in your area. I didn't purchase the membership on Care until I was on here for about two years. I believe it helped me, along with other things. If you're trying to save your money, then continue to search for jobs and hope that the families you apply to have the premium membership. \nBackground checks- In my opinion, they're not necessary, unless a family requests one. If a family interviews you and you both agree that you want to move forward with the hiring process, they will most likely ask about a background check. At that time you can explain to them that you don't currently have one on file, but you're willing to get one at their request and at their expense. I have never purchased a background check. My current family purchased it. It's valid for 6 months. \nReviews- You can ask past employers, family, and friends to post reviews for you. The reviews can help the families get an idea of who you are, how you work with children, your work ethic, etc. I got my current job because the mother saw my profile and reviews, so she reached out to me because of what she read. I never applied for the position. She reached out to me, we met, I fell in love with the baby, and the rest is history...\nGood luck to you, Emma. \nBest,\nKelly \ud83d\ude0a"

However, I'm not sure if you can change the address on your account separately from that, but I think you can. You should go to your account settings and try and see what happens. Also you should include in both your bio on your profile and all apps you send out that you do live in DC full time even though that's not your legal address yet.  Also, I realize this isn't really what the advice you're asking for is about, but you should probably check out laws about when you have to change your address legally so that you're not accidentally committing address fraud."

	"text": "Scams come in all shapes and sizes on here just as much as anywhere else in the world. A really common one is someone saying they\u2019re moving from another state who wants you to buy stuff ahead of time and they are sending you a check to cash and pay for the stuff and you can keep some of the money. This check will be bogus and you will be held liable by your bank. Also if they say hurry because their accounts being closed that is a big red flag that screams SCAM!!! Accounts are only closed if people voluntarily close them OR if Care.com recognizes them as a scam. \n\nA good rule of thumb is: if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is.  Be alert and try to \u201cread between the lines\u201d to changes in the info they\u2019re giving you or really bad spelling and grammar. Sometimes it\u2019s someone who\u2019s first language isn\u2019t English, but if they\u2019re living and working at a job good enough to enable them to have a Nanny, their English is usually pretty good. \n\nMake ALL initial communication through the Care.com site until you feel confident this is a \u201creal\u201d person, offering a pay scale, working conditions, and hours that will be satisfactory to you. Do NOT give them any personal info until you\u2019ve at least reached this point. Then it\u2019s best to have them put in for a Carechat with you.  You do not have to give access to your background check to this point either."

Question: can we also request a background check of the family for our own safety? I feel like this,plus reviews or nannies who worked for them would be valuable information for us too!! It goes both ways you know!! What are your options on this? Thanks"

	"text": "Hi!\nI do lots of one time care gigs that turn into having occasional care families who contact me as needed. While I do recommend Nextdoor for others, for me personally, just being a member on Care here is my marketing. At one time years ago, I ordered cards but decided not to give them out as I'm uncomfortable with strangers having my personal contact information. Honestly, as long as you have a nice profile -showcasing your qualifications and experience with minimal grammar errors- with multiple reviews, a background check on file- not needed for many members but some parents will search only for sitters that already have them- and you  already have a great pic there, it can help quite a bit. I've had lots of referrals through families I've met for one time care gigs as well. \nLike others mentioned though, Nextdoor and FB can be great as well; I've just found much more success through this site directly. Wishing you well!"

This is ridiculous. They should be doing a background check on people or something that would be reliable to prove that they are not scammers!!! This is so irritating. I would actually like to know if anyone has had any real luck finding an actual part time/ full time job??"

I then give a tiny bit about me that pertains to the job (like any child-care education you have etc), then I explain what a i am looking for such as a full-time or part-time position as well as my experience. After that I mention if I have a car and that I am pet friendly and am willing to do light housework.
