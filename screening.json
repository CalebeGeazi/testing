Families seek a good fit for their family; conversely, caregivers seek a family that will treat them well on a professional level.\n\nThat being said, how many times have you been contacted, maybe interviewed, and then abruptly ghosted? \n\nSpeaking for myself, it is infuriating; I don't appreciate the waste of time spent organizing detailed response to inquiry and then being left hanging. It's unfortunate that families aren't held accountable for timely responses; caregivers are strongly encouraged to reply within 24 hours or lose response percentage which in turn compromises care pro status. \n\nI typically wait 3-5 days before sending follow-up message after initial inquiry from interested family. If I don't hear back after that, I add them to blocked list and give preference to alternative opportunities that are presented.\n\nMoral of the story: my biggest pet peeve is families that display unprofessional conduct with radio silence and ghosting after reaching out to me for position I wasn't actively seeking or apply for.\n\nWhat are everyone else's thoughts on this subject?"

I think it\u2019s necessary. And not only do I screen moms, I screen dads as well. Parents appreciate when someone asks about them and actually takes the time to listen...and without judgement. \n\nScreening helps me understand families better. I can also refer help and resources if needed. I always ask, \u201cHow do you feel since baby has arrived?\u201d or, \u201cHow\u2019s parenthood?\u201d...something simple just to get the ball rolling. Body language is usually my biggest indication that there may be some postpartum depression.\n\nHas anyone ever screened for postpartum depression? If so, what are some questions ask? If you have not, what questions do you think would be helpful to ask?"

So I respond back in a positive way and say, \"Yes\" too, and then never hear back from them! I even have had 10 messages back and forth and gotten so excited about a job opportunity, for it to just fall through, because a person just never messages back. \nI think what happens is that they have other applicants they are screening and messaging besides me, and someone else becomes a better candidate than me. Then they just suddenly stop contact with me when they decide they have found someone better suitable for the job. They must have changed their mind about me and found a better fit for their family. Some people probably figure that the no more messages from them is the obvious answer that we were not chosen for the job, and that we do not need a reason from them. Or they just get busy and go on to the next person they are pursuing. We just can't take it personal and just need to keep applying and doing the best job on our end at keeping our applications fresh and up-to-date and creative. I highly suggest not sending the same exact thing that is on your profile page. Everyone seems to do that! Send a personal note to the person about your actual capabilities and what you can offer them! Be excited about it! These are the people I like to hire when looking for a babysitter!!!"

Sometimes, 30 or 40 people apply for a job and they are screening all these people and when they choose one, they probably figure that we will assume we didn't get the job and know they must have chosen someone else. It seems rude to us, but it is part of the process, too. Since when has anyone come back to you and said, \"I chose someone else. You didn't get the job.\" I have never gotten that message. They just never write again. And I have applied for tons of jobs and been \"ghosted\" tons of times. It is just part of the screening process, in my opinion. Although, after many messages back and forth and even a visit set up, and then no more contact, I do send another message and ask one more question, and then if no response, I know they got cold feet or found someone better suited for the job.

I have honestly come to this conclusion because I am not seeing this on competitors sites or through local job boards. \n\nOn the caregiver end of this site, I get a lot of replies but never any follow up and I have a 5 star rating and 10 years of experience. I\u2019m also a mom. So that brings me to the employer end of the site. Again, I got some replies to my post, but again...no follow up from the sitters who applied. I ended up hiring someone from a competitor. I don\u2019t know, maybe Care needs to do better screening or perhaps it\u2019s their app/website? Sometimes I get my notifications hours or even a day late. But I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s limited to that problem. I saw someone suggest that the market is oversaturated, but I babysit in the same area I needed to hire someone and there aren\u2019t that many applicants so I am very confused by all of this. \n\nI have been working with the same family for a few years now and unfortunately their son is starting school an hour later than he did the last 3 years and this doesn\u2019t work with my school schedule. 3 years ago, I was choosing between three good job offers when I started school AND had less flexibility. Very fast follow up too. The market around here isn\u2019t oversaturated at all, so I don\u2019t get it. Maybe the competitor (which I won\u2019t mention because they may delete this post) is taking their business, as it\u2019s free for everything...even the background check.

This is possibly an attempt by care.com to increase security and reduce liability. I absolutely support care.com in this effort.  I hope that eventually they will also do background checks on parents.  FYI,  I followed the care.com links related to this and found the following:\nWhat is a CareCheck?\nAs of July 2019, we have begun rolling out an enhanced caregiver screening to include a background check called a CareCheck. This process will take some time. We collect your legal name, permanent address, birth date, and Social Security Number so that our background check vendor, Sterling Talent Solutions, can run your CareCheck. There is no cost to you for the CareCheck which includes:\nSocial Security Number trace\nNational Sex Offender Public Website search\nMulti-jurisdictional criminal database search\nFederal and county criminal records search\nWhen your CareCheck is complete, your profile will display a CareCheck badge with the date that the last CareCheck was run. We ask for your patience as we work to complete this change through the remainder of this year. We expect to refresh CareChecks annually for caregivers who remain active on the Care.com platform\nWe do not run CareChecks on people looking for caregivers.\nEach of us will have to decide if this is something we can live with.  If not, understand that you will NOT be able to remain active on care.com.  Please, if you disagree with this policy, DO NOT take it out on me.

She communicated via text and email. She claimed to have a baby recovering from surgery and desiring a babysitter to purchase rehabilitation equipment, including a wheelchair,  before her family relocates to South Florida. She told my daughter she would send money for these purchases along with her first week salary. This, of course, concerned us on many levels. Both my wife and I begin investigating through our mutual FBI/Police associates. Ms Gary did send the check for the equipment and first week salary. Both the Kentucky bank that the check was from and the FBI advised that the check was a fraud. Furthermore Ms Gary requested that my daughter deposit the check at an ATM and send her the deposit slip so she can have banking info from my daughter,\nWhen Ms Gary realized that we were on to her, we never heard from her again.\n\nNever one to give up, my daughter tried Care. Com again.\nThis time, the hiring person Brienne Edwards was local. Despite an occasional late payment, this situation began somewhat tolerable. As of about 2 weeks ago, Ms Edwards informed my daughter that her services will no longer be needed and was to settle up with on last Friday (6 Dec 2019). Despite text to the contrary, Ms Edwards decided  not to pay my daughter all of the money mutually agreed upon.  We have ultimately decided against legal action since there was no contract but do take some comfort in my daughter finally terminating her association with Care.Com.\n\nI actually blame Care.Com as much as I blame the individuals. I do not know if it is the lack of screening/vetting or lack of staff but I think this is despicable, unprofessional, unsatisfactory and yes very disappointing."

Also, has wanted background checks for members these days which I am fine with, but just food for thought for our group for future reference.  With this in mind, for the group to grow and have longevity attributes, should we have a rule or something that background checks are okay to do if you want to include that in your blog but it's not required???   This is what I would propose and I do think it should be up for discussion.   I do like the word \"ultimate\" as a possible term to be used in the motto of the group.  For instance, the motto might say \"get ultimate care for multiple types of care\" or something to that effect.   Just a suggestion!!   \nAgain, regarding the background check,I think it should not be required but okay if you want to include it in your blog if you have gotten one yourself.   Any other options?  I have not gotten one yet through CC as u have been thinking of quitting with them anyway.\n2)   What about new caregivers who want to join?   What rules, if any, does the group want to implement?  I gave one example above about background checks!  I just think if we have no plans at all in this regard, we could get a bad reputation really quickly if someone with no experience at all gets hired under our name, for instance someone who might be on drugs.

I have an autoimmune disease and when I get sick it hits me hard, so I feel so foolish continuing to work knowing the risk. Its one thing to keep working if you're with the same family every day, but I feel silly continuing to work with new families, am I overreacting? Would you guys continue to work in this setting? The agency basically just has the honor system for screening families and providers so there really isn't a guarantee of my safety. Is this the kind of thing you guys think I should reach out to my boss over?"

	"text": "Hi!\n\nIt happens very often. Specially with families working from home and adapting to new normal, it is a lot for them to handle. Additionally, they are also screening dozens more profiles and trying to find best fit to their family needs. \n\nWhen I send my availability, I also place a reminder in my personal calendar to follow up with them. It could be that they need to check with their partner on date and time for both to join the phone or web interview, kids got them too busy and they forgot, etc... Just send a sweet and short follow up message. If after that there's still no reply, just move to other jobs. \n\nGood luck!"

I see this brand new job available when I logged in this morning and it was right up the road from me, so I message this person (which just opened the account this morning) and she messages back and says to email her because she's pretty much deleting her account (that she had just made that day?) So I was like okay whatever so I emailed this person at the email they gave me. I get a message back from them and is going on about how their 2 year old son just had surgery on his knee and how he couldn't walk and she was going to work me from 9 am to 3 pm. Paying $25 an hour! And that she would have paid me the week before I started to assure me staying and helping. She also asked for my address, name, gender, number, and date of birth. Which was kind of weird. Then I keep reading and she says they're moving here before June 15th and she needs me to go purchase an electric wheelchair and some other things in order to take care of her son. She said she'd pay for it so I was like hmmm okay? Well, the way the whole email was said, it was just too professional and something didn't seem right about it. So I go on my app and try to look at the profile (it had been deleted at this time) and then I get an email from Care.com saying basically THEY deleted this profile because of suspicious activity!!!! And to pretty much stop contacting these people and if I chose to stay in contact with them, to get a background screening and everything like that!! Has anyone else had this problem?!"

Instead of directly saying: \u201cwe are no longer a free site,\u201d they took a less honorable, evasive and secrecy laden approach: \u201clook we are offering you a cool new service that will let families be happy,\u201d when in reality that\u2019s not beneficial to use caregivers at all. We will not be further protected at all. The families will only have people on the site who have the carebadge, so you\u2019re not standing out by having it. It\u2019s of no benefit. Had they come out and been upfront and real from the beginning, I would have respected them and trusted them. I certainly don\u2019t feel comfortable giving my SSN or Credit Card info to any company, retailer, person I do not trust. That is the issue I find with them, their dishonest approach.\n\nI contacted them directly and was told: \u201cthose with premium already pay for the screening, those without premium will need to pay for the screening,\u201d so anybody who did carecheck a month ago, be advised you will also need to pay, and they said: \u201ccarecheck will need to be updated each year,\u201d which is an indirect, misleading, evasive, secretive way of saying YOU WILL PAY EACH YEARLY for this site.\n\nWhen I first contacted care.com about the carecheck when it was first announced, which I feel is a front to transition the site to be paid membership only, I was directly quoted this in an email: \u201cThere is no cost to you for the CareCheck which includes:\u201d The magic words THERE IS NO COST TO YOU, and now there is suddenly a cost? What was free a month ago suddenly costs! Ha. Read the writing on the wall. Untrustworthy. Dishonorable. Dissembling. \n\nThat\u2019s my two cents. With the overabundance of scammers, and their \u201cwe are so concerned with safety\u201d that we took away CareChat, so now you must communicate via phone and email \u2014 makes it seem like I\u2019d be paying to use Craigslist! At least they anonymize my email (I actually have joined an agency in my area and have found GREAT SUCCESS using the Nextdoor app. Which reminds me care.com just asked me to rate them via AppleStore... why of course, perhaps I\u2019ll just copy paste this)!!\n\nGreat minds have said, when someone shows you who they are, believe them...\n\nCheers."

I do apologize if you found our safety screening disappointing. We created this feature based on feedback from members just like you, and we will make sure to pass your experience and suggestions on to our Product Management team for review. We are always grateful when our members let us know if something isn\u2019t working well, or when they have an idea of how something could work better!&nbsp;\n\nWe realize this new fee may mean that some caregivers will not be able to continue on Care.com, but we believe this is an essential step toward a safer platform with fully engaged care providers. We also believe that a Care.com basic membership offers the best value of any care platform, including access to the most jobs across the country, the ability to build trust with families with a background check badge, and the ability to keep 100 percent of all wages earned.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;Our commitment to innovation is reflected in the ongoing advancement of our safety tools and features to improve trust and connectivity on the platform.&nbsp; These include a new coronavirus-related self-reporting feature now available on your profile.&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;Safety on all fronts remains critical to building trust between families looking for care and the caregiving workforce. When engaged workers are easier to find, matches happen more quickly.\n\n&nbsp;If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to let me know or you can visit our&nbsp;Help&nbsp;page.\n\nBest Wishes,\nJenny\nCare.com Member Care\n\nMy response...\n\nThis is literally a slap in the face. You guys ought to be ashamed of yourselves. This is a money scheme and nothing more. Because I can guarantee that NO Caregiver on the site asked to have a required $15 fee to KEEP their account. If you guys were ACTUALLY listening to your Caregivers, the ones who bring you more account holders, you would read TONS of stuff on the site, community forum, that everyone is appalled by this FORCED fee. What they ARE asking for, is MORE safety for themselves. Where are the background checks for the families we are applying to?? We have NO IDEA what we're getting ourselves into when going to meet a family. Some of your CAREGIVERS on the site have been treated very poorly by families on your site. But do you even care about them?! No, you care about charging someone who is trying to make money, a FORCED fee, JUST for them to keep their account active. Let's get something straight as well, I'm not against a background check. I am against a FORCED fee for one, when there is NO GUARANTEE that I will find a job, or that MY safety is JUST as important as the families we are applying to. If a family that I apply to wants me to get a background check, then I would gladly get one, have before. But to make it an annual fee to KEEP my account, is highway robbery.\n\nIf you TRULY cared about a safer platform, like you claim, you would require your families looking for help, to also get the SAME background check. And to say that you are trying to get a 'safer platform with fully engaged care providers', is so disrespectful. To say that someone isn't 'fully engaged' because they don't want to pay an annual fee, that is a money scheme, is beyond rude. Again we are the ones that pass the word of mouth to other people. And again you mention, 'Safety on all fronts remains critical to building trust between families looking for care and the caregiving workforce'. It's a farce. Because it's not safety on all fronts, because this is totally one sided. When you require families looking for help to get a background check, then it will be 'On all fronts'. Until then, tell it like it is...'We are now charging an annual fee for our BASIC membership.' Be upfront, honest, and EQUAL on all fronts, and you'll have more memberships, and people actually trusting you.\n\nI will not be paying the fee, and I will NOT be recommending Care.com to anyone else. Will be doing the exact opposite actually. I've had 3 jobs through the site, since 2013. I used to tell everyone to go to Care.com, families looking for help, and caregivers looking for work. No more.&nbsp;\n\nGod Bless and have a nice day.\nJanelle"

Verify how far away they really are from you, what the pay scale will really be, and what the job duties are. The area I am in sometimes homes aren\u2019t that far but can take inordinately long to get there because of construction and location near hospitals etc. A lot of people will post that they\u2019re paying a certain amount but then they\u2019ll try to say well we can only afford to pay $200 a week when it\u2019s a full-time job. Don\u2019t even bother trying to negotiate with people like that! Simply say no, sorry! Don\u2019t let them get your hopes up and waste your time. I don\u2019t mind if the duties include letting a dog in and out and me and the child can play with the dog, but I\u2019m not doing things like vacuuming or making beds. I only clean up the mess the kids and I make. If there is a long naptime, I will volunteer to prep something for dinner because I like to cook and I get bored, but that\u2019s it. Decide what you are and are not willing to do and what you need to get paid to make it worth your while.

I didn't, which I thought was because I pay for a BGC every 6 months but others who do the same did get the message that they'd need to be charged so I'm not sure what Care's criteria is for who they are requiring to pay the fee."
